An elderly\\n\\nman, who Was seated on the porch of a large house, started\\n\\nto his feet in alarm.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Gracious goodness! What was that, Mrs. Baggert?\" he\\n\\ncalled to a motherly-looking woman who stood in the doorway.\\n\\n\"What happened?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Nothing much, Mr. Swift,\" was the calm reply \"I think\\n\\nthat was Tom and Mr. Sharp in their airship, that\\'s all. I\\n\\ndidn\\'t see it, but the noise sounded like that of the Red Cloud.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Of course! To be sure!\" exclaimed Mr. Barton Swift, the\\n\\nwell-known inventor, as he started down the path in order to\\n\\nget a good view of the air, unobstructed by the trees. \"Yes,\\n\\nthere they are,\" he added. \"That\\'s the airship, but I didn\\'t\\n\\nexpect them back so soon. They must have made good time from\\n\\nShopton. I wonder if anything can be the matter that they\\n\\nhurried so?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe gazed aloft toward where a queerly-shaped machine was\\n\\ncircling about nearly five hundred feet in the air, for the\\n\\ncraft, after Swooping down close to the house, had ascended\\n\\nand was now hovering just above the line of breakers that\\n\\nmarked the New Jersey seacoast, where Mr. Swift had taken up\\n\\na temporary residence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Don\\'t begin worrying, Mr. Swift,\" advised Mrs. Baggert,\\n\\nthe housekeeper. \"You\\'ve got too much to do, if you get that\\n\\nnew boat done, to worry.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s so. I must not worry. But I wish Tom and Mr. Sharp\\n\\nwould land, for I want to talk to them.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAs if the occupants of the airship had heard the words of\\n\\nthe aged inventor, they headed their craft toward earth. The\\n\\ncombined aeroplane and dirigible balloon, a most wonderful\\n\\ntraveler of the air, swung around, and then, with the\\n\\ndeflection rudders slanted downward, came on with a rush.\\n\\nWhen near the landing place, just at the side of the house,\\n\\nthe motor was stopped, and the gas, with a hissing noise,\\n\\nrushed into the red aluminum container. This immediately\\n\\nmade the ship more buoyant and it landed almost as gently as\\n\\na feather.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo sooner had the wheels which formed the lower part of\\n\\nthe craft touched the ground than there leaped from the\\n\\ncabin of the Red Cloud a young man.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, dad!\" he exclaimed. \"Here we are again, safe and\\n\\nsound. Made a record, too. Touched ninety miles an hour at\\n\\ntimes--didn\\'t we, Mr. Sharp?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s what,\" agreed a tall, thin, dark-complexioned man,\\n\\nwho followed Tom Swift more leisurely in his exit from the\\n\\ncabin. Mr. Sharp, a veteran aeronaut, stopped to fasten guy\\n\\nropes from the airship to strong stakes driven into the\\n\\nground.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And we\\'d have done better, only we struck a hard wind\\n\\nagainst us about two miles up in the air, which delayed us,\"\\n\\nwent on Tom. \"Did you hear us coming, dad?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, and it startled him,\" put in Mrs. Baggert. \"I guess\\n\\nhe wasn\\'t expecting you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, well, I shouldn\\'t have been so alarmed, only I was\\n\\nthinking deeply about a certain change I am going to make in\\n\\nthe submarine, Tom. I was day-dreaming, I think, when your\\n\\nship whizzed through the air. But tell me, did you find\\n\\neverything all right at Shopton? No signs of any of those\\n\\nscoundrels of the Happy Harry gang having been around?\" and\\n\\nMr. Swift looked anxiously at his son.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not a sign, dad,\" replied Tom quickly. \"Everything was\\n\\nall right. We brought the things you wanted. They\\'re in the\\n\\nairship. Oh, but it was a fine trip. I\\'d like to take\\n\\nanother right out to sea.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not now, Tom,\" said his father. \"I want you to help me.\\n\\nAnd I need Mr. Sharp\\'s help, too. Get the things out of the\\n\\ncar, and we\\'ll go to the shop.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"First I think we\\'d better put the airship away,\" advised\\n\\nMr. Sharp. \"I don\\'t just like the looks of the weather, and,\\n\\nbesides, if we leave the ship exposed we\\'ll be sure to have\\n\\na crowd around sooner or later, and we don\\'t want that.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, indeed,\" remarked the aged inventor hastily. \"I don\\'t\\n\\nwant people prying around the submarine shed. By all means\\n\\nput the airship away, and then come into the shop.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIn spite of its great size the aeroplane was easily\\n\\nwheeled along by Tom and Mr. Sharp, for the gas in the\\n\\ncontainer made it so buoyant that it barely touched the\\n\\nearth. A little more of the powerful vapor and the Red\\n\\nCloud would have risen by itself. In a few minutes the\\n\\nwonderful craft, of which my readers have been told in\\n\\ndetail in a previous volume, was safely housed in a large\\n\\ntent, which was securely fastened.\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Sharp and Tom, carrying some bundles which they had\\n\\ntaken from the car, or cabin, of the craft, went toward a\\n\\nlarge shed, which adjoined the house that Mr. Swift had\\n\\nhired for the season at the seashore. They found the lad\\'s\\n\\nfather standing before a great shape, which loomed up dimly\\n\\nin the semi-darkness of the building. It was like an immense\\n\\ncylinder, pointed at either end, and here and there were\\n\\nopenings, covered with thick glass, like immense, bulging\\n\\neyes. From the number of tools and machinery all about the\\n\\nplace, and from the appearance of the great cylinder itself,\\n\\nit was easy to see that it was only partly completed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, how goes it, dad?\" asked the youth, as he deposited\\n\\nhis bundle on a bench. \"Do you think you can make it work?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I think so, Tom. The positive and negative plates are\\n\\ngiving me considerable trouble, though. But I guess we can\\n\\nsolve the problem. Did you bring me the galvanometer?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, and all the other things,\" and the young inventor\\n\\nproceeded to take the articles from the bundles he carried.\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Swift looked them over carefully, while Tom walked\\n\\nabout examining the submarine, for such was the queer craft\\n\\nthat was contained in the shed.  He noted that some progress\\n\\nhad been made on it since he had left the seacoast several\\n\\ndays before to make a trip to Shopton, in New York State,\\n\\nwhere the Swift home was located, after some tools and\\n\\napparatus that his father wanted to obtain from his workshop\\n\\nthere.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You and Mr. Jackson have put on several new plates,\"\\n\\nobserved the lad after a pause.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes,\" admitted his father. \"Garret and I weren\\'t idle,\\n\\nwere we, Garret?\" and he nodded to the aged engineer, who\\n\\nhad been in his employ for many years.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No; and I guess we\\'ll soon have her in the water, Tom,\\n\\nnow that you and Mr. Sharp are here to help us,\" replied\\n\\nGarret Jackson.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We ought to have Mr. Damon here to bless the submarine\\n\\nand his liver and collar buttons a few times,\" put in Mr.\\n\\nSharp, who brought in another bundle. He referred to an\\n\\neccentric individual Who had recently made an airship voyage\\n\\nwith himself and Tom, Mr. Damon\\'s peculiarity being to use\\n\\ncontinually such expressions as: \"Bless my soul! Bless my\\n\\nliver!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll be glad when we can make a trial trip,\" went\\n\\non Tom. \"I\\'ve traveled pretty fast on land with my motor-\\n\\ncycle, and we certainly have hummed through the air. Now I\\n\\nwant to see how it feels to scoot along under water.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, if everything goes well we\\'ll be in position to\\n\\nmake a trial trip inside of a month,\" remarked the aged\\n\\ninventor. \"look here, Mr. Sharp, I made a change in the\\n\\nsteering gear, which I\\'d like you and Tom to consider.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe three walked around to the rear of the odd-looking\\n\\nstructure, if an object shaped like a cigar can be said to\\n\\nhave a front and rear, and the inventor, his son, and the\\n\\naeronaut were soon deep in a discussion of the\\n\\ntechnicalities connected with under-water navigation.\\n\\n\\n\\nA little later they went into the house, in response to a\\n\\nsummons from the supper bell, vigorously rung by Mrs.\\n\\nBaggert. She was not fond of waiting with meals, and even\\n\\nthe most serious problem of mechanics was, in her\\n\\nestimation, as nothing compared with having the soup get\\n\\ncold, or the possibility of not having the meat done to a\\n\\nturn.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe meal was interspersed with remarks about the recent\\n\\nairship flight of Tom and Mr. Sharp, and discussions about\\n\\nthe new submarine. This talk went on even after the table\\n\\nwas cleared off and the three had adjourned to the sitting-\\n\\nroom. There Mr. Swift brought out pencil and paper, and soon\\n\\nhe and Mr. Sharp were engrossed in calculating the pressure\\n\\nper square inch of sea water at a depth of three miles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Do you intend to go as deep as that?\" asked Tom, looking\\n\\nup from a paper he was reading.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Possibly,\" replied his father; and his son resumed his\\n\\nperusal of the sheet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Now,\" went on the inventor to the aeronaut, \"I have\\n\\nanother plan. In addition to the positive and negative\\n\\nplates which will form our motive power, I am going to\\n\\ninstall forward and aft propellers, to use in case of\\n\\naccident.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I say, dad! Did you see this?\" suddenly exclaimed Tom,\\n\\ngetting up from his chair, and holding his finger on a\\n\\ncertain place in the page of the paper.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Did I see what?\" asked Mr. Swift.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why, this account of the sinking of the treasure ship.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Treasure ship? No. Where?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Listen,\" went on Tom. \"I\\'ll read it: \\'Further advices\\n\\nfrom Montevideo, Uruguay, South America, state that all hope\\n\\nhas been given up of recovering the steamship Boldero, which\\n\\nfoundered and went down off that coast in the recent gale.\\n\\nNot only has all hope been abandoned of raising the vessel,\\n\\nbut it is feared that no part of the three hundred thousand\\n\\ndollars in gold bullion which she carried will ever be\\n\\nrecovered. Expert divers who were taken to the scene of the\\n\\nwreck state that the depth of water, and the many currents\\n\\nexisting there, due to a submerged shoal, preclude any\\n\\npossibility of getting at the hull. The bullion, it is\\n\\nbelieved, was to have been used to further the interests of\\n\\na certain revolutionary faction, but it seems likely that\\n\\nthey will have to look elsewhere for the sinews of war.\\n\\nBesides the bullion the ship also carried several cases of\\n\\nrifles, it is stated, and other valuable cargo. The crew and\\n\\nwhat few passengers the Boldero carried were, contrary to\\n\\nthe first reports, all saved by taking to the boats. It\\n\\nappears that some of the ship\\'s plates were sprung by the\\n\\nstress in which she labored in a storm, and she filled and\\n\\nsank gradually.\\' There! what do you think of that, dad?\"\\n\\ncried Tom as he finished.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What do I think of it? Why, I think it\\'s too bad for the\\n\\nrevolutionists, Tom, of course.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No; I mean about the treasure being still on board the\\n\\nship. What about that?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s likely to stay there, if the divers can\\'t get\\n\\nat it. Now, Mr. Sharp, about the propellers--\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Wait, dad!\" cried Tom earnestly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why, Tom, what\\'s the matter?\" asked Mr. Swift in some\\n\\nsurprise.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"How soon before we can finish our submarine?\" went on\\n\\nTom, not answering the question.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"About a month. Why?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why? Dad, why can\\'t we have a try for that treasure? It\\n\\nought to be comparatively easy to find that sunken ship off\\n\\nthe coast of Uruguay. In our submarine we can get close up\\n\\nto it, and in the new diving suits you invented we can get\\n\\nat that gold bullion. Three hundred thousand dollars! Think\\n\\nof it, dad! Three hundred thousand dollars! We could easily\\n\\nclaim all of it, since the owners have abandoned it, but we\\n\\nwould be satisfied with half. Let\\'s hurry up, finish the\\n\\nsubmarine, and have a try for it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But, Tom, you forget that I am to enter my new ship in\\n\\nthe trials for the prize offered by the United States\\n\\nGovernment.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"How much is the prize if you win it?\" asked Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Fifty thousand dollars.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, here\\'s a chance to make three times that much at\\n\\nleast, and maybe more. Dad, let the Government prize go, and\\n\\ntry for the treasure. Will you?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom looked eagerly at his father, his eyes shining with\\n\\nanticipation. Mr. Swift was not a quick thinker, but the\\n\\nidea his son had proposed made an impression on him. He\\n\\nreached out his hand for the paper in which the young\\n\\ninventor had seen the account of the sunken treasure.\\n\\nSlowly he read it through. Then he passed it to Mr. Sharp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What do you think of it?\" he asked of the aeronaut\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There\\'s a possibility,\" remarked the balloonist \"We might\\n\\ntry for it. We can easily go three miles down, and it\\n\\ndoesn\\'t lie as deeply as that, if this account is true. Yes,\\n\\nwe might try for it. But we\\'d have to omit the Government\\n\\ncontests.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Will you, dad?\" asked Tom again.\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Swift considered a moment longer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, Tom, I will,\" he finally decided. \"Going after the\\n\\ntreasure will be likely to afford us a better test of the\\n\\nsubmarine than would any Government tests. We\\'ll try to\\n\\nlocate the sunken Boldero.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hurrah!\" cried the lad, taking the paper from Mr. Sharp\\n\\nand waving it in the air. \"That\\'s the stuff!  Now for a\\n\\nsearch for the submarine treasure!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Two\\n\\n\\n\\nFinishing the Submarine\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" cried Mrs. Baggert, the housekeeper,\\n\\nhurrying in from the kitchen, where she was washing the\\n\\ndishes. \"Have you seen some of those scoundrels who robbed\\n\\nyou, Mr. Swift? If you have, the police down here ought to--\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, it\\'s nothing like that,\" explained Mr. Swift. \"Tom\\n\\nhas merely discovered in the paper an account of a sunken\\n\\ntreasure ship, and he wants us to go after it, down under\\n\\nthe ocean.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, dear! Some more of Captain Kidd\\'s hidden hoard, I\\n\\nsuppose?\" ventured the housekeeper. \"Don\\'t you bother with\\n\\nit, Mr. Swift. I had a cousin once, and he got set in the\\n\\nnotion that he knew where that pirate\\'s treasure was. He\\n\\nspent all the money he had and all he could borrow digging\\n\\nfor it, and he never found a penny. Don\\'t waste your time on\\n\\nsuch foolishness. It\\'s bad enough to be building airships\\n\\nand submarines without going after treasure.\"  Mrs. Baggert\\n\\nspoke with the freedom of an old friend rather than a hired\\n\\nhousekeeper, but she had been in the family ever since Tom\\'s\\n\\nmother died, when he was a baby, and she had many\\n\\nprivileges.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, this isn\\'t any of Kidd\\'s treasure,\" Tom assured her.\\n\\n\"If we get it, Mrs. Baggert, I\\'ll buy you a diamond ring.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Humph!\" she exclaimed, as Tom began to hug her in boyish\\n\\nfashion. \"I guess I\\'ll have to buy all the diamond rings I\\n\\nwant, if I have to depend on your treasure for them,\" and\\n\\nshe went back to the kitchen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" went on Mr. Swift after a pause, \"if we are going\\n\\ninto the treasure-hunting business, Tom, we\\'ll have to get\\n\\nright to work. In the first place, we must find out more\\n\\nabout this ship, and just where it was sunk.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I can do that part,\" said Mr. Sharp. \"I know some sea\\n\\ncaptains, and they can put me on the track of locating the\\n\\nexact spot. In fact, it might not be a bad idea to take an\\n\\nexpert navigator with us. I can manage in the air all right,\\n\\nbut I confess that working out a location under water is\\n\\nbeyond me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, an old sea captain wouldn\\'t be a bad idea, by any\\n\\nmeans,\" conceded Mr. Swift. \"Well, if you\\'ll attend to that\\n\\ndetail, Mr. Sharp, Tom, Mr. Jackson and I will finish the\\n\\nsubmarine. Most of the work is done, however, and it only\\n\\nremains to install the engine and motors. Now, in regard to\\n\\nthe negative and positive electric plates, I\\'d like your\\n\\nopinion, Tom.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFor Tom Swift was an inventor, second in ability only to\\n\\nhis father, and his advice was often sought by his parent on\\n\\nmatters of electrical construction, for the lad had made a\\n\\nspecialty of that branch of science.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile father and son were deep in a discussion of the\\n\\napparatus of the submarine, there will be an opportunity to\\n\\nmake the reader a little better acquainted with them. Those\\n\\nof you who have read the previous volumes of this series do\\n\\nnot need to be told who Tom Swift is. Others, however, may\\n\\nbe glad to have a proper introduction to him.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom Swift lived with his father, Barton Swift, in the\\n\\nvillage of Shopton, New York. The Swift home was on the\\n\\noutskirts of the town, and the large house was surrounded by\\n\\na number of machine shops, in which father and son, aided by\\n\\nGarret Jackson, the engineer, did their experimental and\\n\\nconstructive work. Their house was not far from Lake\\n\\nCarlopa, a fairly large body of water, on which Tom often\\n\\nspeeded his motor\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the first volume of this series, entitled \"Tom Swift\\n\\nand His Motor-Cycle,\" it was told how be became acquainted\\n\\nwith Mr. Wakefield Damon, who suffered an accident while\\n\\nriding one of the speedy machines. The accident disgusted\\n\\nMr. Damon with motor-cycles, and Tom secured it for a low\\n\\nprice. He had many adventures on it, chief among which was\\n\\nbeing knocked senseless and robbed of a valuable patent\\n\\nmodel belonging to his father, which he was taking to\\n\\nAlbany. The attack was committed by a gang known as the\\n\\nHappy Harry gang, who were acting at the instigation of a\\n\\nsyndicate of rich men, who wanted to secure control of a\\n\\ncertain patent turbine engine which Mr. Swift had invented.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom set out in pursuit of the thieves, after recovering\\n\\nfrom their attack, and had a strenuous time before he\\n\\nlocated them.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the second volume, entitled \"Tom Swift and His Motor-\\n\\nBoat,\" there was related our hero\\'s adventures in a fine\\n\\ncraft which was recovered from the thieves and sold at\\n\\nauction. There was a mystery connected with the boat, and\\n\\nfor a long time Tom could not solve it. He was aided,\\n\\nhowever, by his chum, Ned Newton, who worked in the Shopton\\n\\nBank, and also by Mr. Damon and Eradicate Sampson, an aged\\n\\ncolored whitewasher, who formed quite an attachment for Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn his motor-boat Tom had more than one race with Andy\\n\\nFoger, a rich lad of Shopton, who was a sort of bully. He\\n\\nhad red hair and squinty eyes, and was as mean in character\\n\\nas he was in looks. He and his cronies, Sam Snedecker and\\n\\nPete Bailey, made trouble for Tom, chiefly because Tom\\n\\nmanaged to beat Andy twice in boat races.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was while in his motor-boat, Arrow, that Tom formed the\\n\\nacquaintance of John Sharp, a veteran balloonist. While\\n\\ncoming down Lake Carlopa on the way to the Swift home, which\\n\\nhad been entered by thieves, Tom, his father and Ned Newton,\\n\\nsaw a balloon on fire over the lake. Hanging from a trapeze\\n\\non it was Mr. Sharp, who had made an ascension from a fair\\n\\nground. By hard work on the part of Tom and his friends the\\n\\naeronaut was saved, and took up his residence with the\\n\\nSwifts.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis advent was most auspicious, for Tom and his father\\n\\nwere then engaged in perfecting an airship, and Mr. Sharp\\n\\nwas able to lend them his skill, so that the craft was soon\\n\\nconstructed.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the third volume, called \"Tom Swift and His Airship,\"\\n\\nthere was set down the doings of the young inventor, Mr.\\n\\nSharp and Mr. Damon on a trip above the clouds. They\\n\\nundertook it merely for pleasure, but they encountered\\n\\nconsiderable danger, before they completed it, for they\\n\\nnearly fell into a blazing forest once, and were later fired\\n\\nat by a crowd of excited people. This last act was to effect\\n\\ntheir capture, for they were taken for a gang of bank\\n\\nrobbers, and this was due directly to Andy Foger.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe morning after Tom and his friends started on their\\n\\ntrip in the air, the Shopton Bank was found to have been\\n\\nlooted of seventy-five thousand dollars. Andy Foger at once\\n\\ntold the police that Tom Swift had taken the money, and when\\n\\nasked how he knew this, he said he had seen Tom hanging\\n\\naround the bank the night before the vault was burst open,\\n\\nand that the young inventor had some burglar tools in his\\n\\npossession. Warrants were at once sworn out for Tom and Mr.\\n\\nDamon, who was also accused of being one of the robbers, and\\n\\na reward of five thousand dollars was offered.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom, Mr. Damon and Mr. Sharp sailed on, all unaware of\\n\\nthis, and unable to account for being fired upon, until they\\n\\naccidentally read in the paper an account of their supposed\\n\\nmisdeeds. They lost no time in starting back home, and on,\\n\\nthe way got on the track of the real bank robbers, who were\\n\\nmembers of the Happy Harry gang.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow the robbers were captured in an exciting raid, how Tom\\n\\nrecovered most of the stolen money, and how he gave Andy\\n\\nFoger a deserved thrashing for giving a false clue was told\\n\\nof, and there was an account of a race in which the Red\\n\\nCloud (as the airship was called) took part, as well as\\n\\ndetails of how Tom and his friends secured the reward, which\\n\\nAndy Foger hoped to collect.\\n\\n\\n\\nThose of you who care to know how the Red Cloud was\\n\\nconstructed, and how she behaved in the air, even during\\n\\naccidents and when struck by lightning, may learn by reading\\n\\nthe third volume, for the airship was one of the most\\n\\nsuccessful ever constructed.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the craft was finished, and the navigators were ready\\n\\nto start on their first long trip, Mr. Swift was asked to go\\n\\nwith them. He declined, but would not tell why, until Tom,\\n\\npressing him for an answer, learned that his father was\\n\\nplanning a submarine boat, which he hoped to enter in some\\n\\ntrials for Government prizes. Mr. Swift remained at home to\\n\\nwork on this submarine, while his son and Mr. Sharp were\\n\\nsailing above the clouds.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn their return, however, and after the bank mystery had\\n\\nbeen cleared up, Tom and Mr. Sharp, aided Mr. Swift in\\n\\ncompleting the submarine, until, when the present story\\n\\nopens, it needed but little additional work to make the\\n\\ncraft ready for the water.\\n\\n\\n\\nOf course it had to be built near the sea, as it would\\n\\nhave been impossible to transport it overland from Shopton.\\n\\nSo, before the keel was laid, Mr. Swift rented a large\\n\\ncottage at a seaside place on the New Jersey coast and\\n\\nthere, after, erecting a large shed, the work on the\\n\\nAdvance, as the under-water ship was called, was begun.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was soon to be launched in a large creek that extended\\n\\nin from the ocean and had plenty of water at high tide. Tom\\n\\nand Mr. Sharp made several trips back and forth from Shopton\\n\\nin their airship, to see that all was safe at home and\\n\\noccasionally to get needed tools and supplies from the\\n\\nshops, for not all the apparatus could be moved from Shopton\\n\\nto the coast.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was when returning from one of these trips that Tom\\n\\nbrought with him the paper containing an account of the\\n\\nwreck of the Boldero and the sinking of the treasure she\\n\\ncarried.\\n\\n\\n\\nUntil late that night the three fortune-hunters discussed\\n\\nvarious matters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We\\'ll hurry work on the ship,\" said Mr. Swift it length.\\n\\n\"Tom, I wonder if your friend, Mr. Damon, would care to try\\n\\nhow it seems under Water? He stood the air trip fairly\\n\\nwell.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll write and ask him,\" answered the lad. \"I\\'m sure\\n\\nhe\\'ll go.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSecuring, a few days later, the assistance of two\\n\\nmechanics, whom he knew he could trust, for as yet the\\n\\nconstruction of the Advance was a secret, Mr. Swift prepared\\n\\nto rush work on the submarine, and for the next three weeks\\n\\nthere were busy times in the shed next to the seaside\\n\\ncottage. So busy, in fact, were Tom and Mr. Sharp, that\\n\\nthey only found opportunity for one trip in the airship, and\\n\\nthat was to get some supplies from the shops at home.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" remarked Mr. Swift one night, at the close of a\\n\\nhard day\\'s work, \"another week will see our craft completed.\\n\\nThen we will put it in the water and see how it floats, and\\n\\nwhether it submerges as I hope it does. But come on, Tom. I\\n\\nwant to lock up. I\\'m very tired to-night.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"All right, dad,\" answered the young inventor coming from\\n\\nthe darkened rear of the shop. \"I just want to--\"\\n\\n\\n\\nNe paused suddenly, and appeared to be listening. Then he\\n\\nmoved softly back to where he had come from.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" asked his father in a whisper.\\n\\n\"What\\'s up, Tom?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe lad did not answer Mr. Swift, with a worried look on\\n\\nhis face, followed his son. Mr. Sharp stood in the door of\\n\\nthe shop.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I thought I heard some one moving around back here,\" went\\n\\non Tom quietly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Some one in this shop!\" exclaimed the aged inventor\\n\\nexcitedly. \"Some one trying to steal my ideas again! Mr.\\n\\nSharp, come here! Bring that rifle! We\\'ll teach these\\n\\nscoundrels a lesson!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom quickly darted hack to the extreme rear of the\\n\\nbuilding. There was a scuffle, and the next minute Tom cried\\n\\nout:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What are you doing here?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ha! I beg your pardon,\" replied a voice. \"I am looking\\n\\nfor Mr. Barton Swift.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"My father,\" remarked Tom. \"But that\\'s a queer place to\\n\\nlook for him. He\\'s up front. Father, here\\'s a man who wishes\\n\\nto see you,\" he called.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, I strolled in, and seeing no one about I went to the\\n\\nrear of the place,\" the voice went on. \"I hope I haven\\'t\\n\\ntransgressed.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We were busy on the other side of the shop, I guess,\"\\n\\nreplied Tom, and he looked suspiciously at the man who\\n\\nemerged from the darkness into the light from a window. \"I\\n\\nbeg your pardon for grabbing you the way I did,\" went on the\\n\\nlad, \"but I thought you were one of a gang of men we\\'ve been\\n\\nhaving trouble with.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, that\\'s all right,\" continued the man easily. \"I know\\n\\nMr. Swift, and I think he will remember me. Ah, Mr. Swift,\\n\\nhow do you do?\" he added quickly, catching sight of Tom\\'s\\n\\nfather, who, with Mr. Sharp, was coming to meet the lad.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Addison Berg!\" exclaimed the aged inventor as he saw the\\n\\nman\\'s face more plainly. \"What are you doing here?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I came to see you,\" replied the man. \"May I have a talk\\n\\nwith you privately?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I--I suppose so,\" assented Mr. Swift nervously. \"Come\\n\\ninto the house.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Berg left Tom\\'s side and advanced to where Mr. Swift\\n\\nwas standing. Together the two emerged from the now fast\\n\\ndarkening shop and went toward the house.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Who is he?\" asked Mr. Sharp of the young inventor in a\\n\\nwhisper.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" replied the lad; \"but, whoever he is, dad\\n\\nseems afraid of him. I\\'m going to keep my eyes open.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Three\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Berg is Astonished\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFollowing his father and the stranger whom the aged\\n\\ninventor had addressed as Mr. Berg, Tom and Mr. Sharp\\n\\nentered the house, the lad having first made sure that\\n\\nGarret Jackson was on guard in the shop that contained the\\n\\nsub marine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Now,\" said Mr. Swift to the newcomer, \"I am at your\\n\\nservice. What is it you wish?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"In the first place, let me apologize for having startled\\n\\nyou and your friends,\" began the man. \"I had no idea of\\n\\nsneaking into your workshop, but I had just arrived here,\\n\\nand seeing the doors open I went in. I heard no one about,\\n\\nand I wandered to the back of the place. There I happened to\\n\\nstumble over a board--\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And I heard you,\" interrupted Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Is this one of your employees?\" asked Mr. Berg in rather\\n\\nfrigid tones.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That is my son,\" replied Mr. Swift.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon.\" The man\\'s manner changed quickly.\\n\\n\"Well, I guess you did hear me, young man. I didn\\'t intend\\n\\nto hark my shins the way I did, either. You must have taken\\n\\nme for a burglar or a sneak thief.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I have been very much bothered by a gang of unscrupulous\\n\\nmen,\" said Mr. Swift, \"and I suppose Tom thought it was some\\n\\nof them sneaking around again.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s what I did,\" added the lad. \"I wasn\\'t going to\\n\\nhave any one steal the secret of the submarine if I could\\n\\nhelp it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Quite right! Quite right!\" exclaimed Mr. Berg. \"But my\\n\\npurpose was an open one. As you know, Mr. Swift, I represent\\n\\nthe firm of Bentley & Eagert, builders of submarine boats\\n\\nand torpedoes. They heard that you were constructing a craft\\n\\nto take part in the competitive prize tests of the United\\n\\nStates Government, and they asked me to come and see you to\\n\\nlearn when your ship would be ready. Ours is completed, but\\n\\nwe recognize that it will be for the best interests of all\\n\\nconcerned if there are a number of contestants, and my firm\\n\\ndid not want to send in their entry until they knew that you\\n\\nwere about finished with your ship. How about it? Are you\\n\\nready to compete?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Swift slowly. \"We are about ready. My\\n\\ncraft needs a few finishing touches, and then it will be\\n\\nready to launch.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then we may expect a good contest on your part,\"\\n\\nsuggested Mr. Berg.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" began the aged inventor, \"I don\\'t know about\\n\\nthat.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\" exclaimed Mr. Berg.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I said I wasn\\'t quite sure that we would compete,\" went\\n\\non Mr. Swift. \"You see, when I first got this idea for a\\n\\nsubmarine boat I had it in mind to try for the Government\\n\\nprize of fifty thousand dollars.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s what we want, too,\" interrupted Mr. Berg with a\\n\\nsmile.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But,\" went on Tom\\'s father, \"since then certain matters\\n\\nhave come up, and I think, on the whole, that we\\'ll not\\n\\ncompete for the prize after all.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not compete for the prize?\" almost shouted the agent for\\n\\nBentley & Eagert. \"Why, the idea! You ought to compete. It\\n\\nis good for the trade. We think we have a very fine craft,\\n\\nand probably we would beat you in the tests, but--\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t be too sure of that,\" put in Tom. \"You have\\n\\nonly seen the outside of our boat. The inside is better\\n\\nyet.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ah, I have no doubt of that,\" spoke Mr. Berg, \"but we\\n\\nhave been at the business longer than you have, and have had\\n\\nmore experience. Still we welcome competition. But I am very\\n\\nmuch surprised that you are not going to compete for the\\n\\nprize, Mr. Swift. Very much surprised, indeed! You see, I\\n\\ncame down from Philadelphia to arrange so that we could both\\n\\nenter our ships at the same time. I understand there is\\n\\nanother firm of submarine boat builders who are going to try\\n\\nfor the prize, and I want to arrange a date that will he\\n\\nsatisfactory to all. I am greatly astonished that you are\\n\\nnot going to compete.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, we were going to,\" said Mr. Swift, \"only we have\\n\\nchanged our minds, that\\'s all. My son and I have other\\n\\nplans.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"May I ask what they are?\" questioned Mr. Berg.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You may,\" exclaimed Tom quickly; \"but I don\\'t believe we\\n\\ncan tell you. They\\'re a secret,\" he added more cordially.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, I see,\" retorted Mr. Berg. \"Well, of course I don\\'t\\n\\nwish to penetrate any of your secrets, but I hoped we could\\n\\ncontest together for the Government prize. It is worth\\n\\ntrying for I assure you--fifty thousand dollars. Besides,\\n\\nthere is the possibility of selling a number of submarines\\n\\nto the United States. It\\'s a fine prize.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But the one we are after is a bigger one,\" Cried Tom\\n\\nimpetuously, and the moment he had spoken the wished he\\n\\ncould recall the words.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Eh? What\\'s that?\" exclaimed Mr. Berg. \"You don\\'t mean to\\n\\nsay another government has offered a larger prize? If I had\\n\\nknown that I would not have let my firm enter into the\\n\\ncompetition for the bonus offered by the United States.\\n\\nPlease tell me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry,\" went on Tom more soberly. \"I shouldn\\'t have\\n\\nspoken. Mr. Berg, the plans of my father and myself are such\\n\\nthat we can\\'t reveal them now. We are going to try for a\\n\\nprize, but not in competition with you. It\\'s an entirely\\n\\ndifferent matter.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I guess you\\'ll find that the firm of Bentley &\\n\\nEagert are capable of trying for any prizes that are\\n\\noffered,\" boasted the agent. \"We may be competitors yet.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t believe so,\" replied Mr. Swift\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We may,\" repeated Mr. Berg. \"And if we do, please\\n\\nremember that we will show no mercy. Our boats are the\\n\\nbest.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And may the best boat win,\" interjected Mr. Sharp.\\n\\n\"That\\'s all we ask. A fair field and no favors.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Of course,\" spoke the agent coldly. \"Is this another son\\n\\nof yours?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No but a good friend,\" replied the aged inventor. \"No,\\n\\nMr. Berg, we won\\'t compete this time. You may tell your firm\\n\\nso.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Very good,\" was the other\\'s stiff reply. \"Then\\n\\nI will bid you good night. We shall carry off the\\n\\nGovernment prize, but permit me to add that I\\n\\nam very much astonished, very much indeed, that\\n\\nyou do not try for the prize. From what I have\\n\\nseen of your submarine you have a very good\\n\\none, almost as good, in some respects, as ours.\\n\\nI bid you good night,\" and with a bow the man\\n\\nleft the room and hurried away from the house.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Four\\n\\n\\n\\nTom is Imprisoned\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I must say he\\'s a cool one,\" remarked Tom, as the\\n\\nechoes of Mr. Berg\\'s steps died away. \"The idea of thinking\\n\\nhis boat better than ours! I don\\'t like that man, dad. I\\'m\\n\\nsuspicious of him. Do you think he came here to steal some\\n\\nof our ideas?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, I hardly believe so, my son. But how did you discover\\n\\nhim?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Just as you saw, dad. I heard a noise and went back there\\n\\nto investigate. I found him sneaking around, looking at the\\n\\nelectric propeller plates. I went to grab him just as he\\n\\nstumbled over a hoard. At first I thought it was one of the\\n\\nold gang. I\\'m almost sure he was trying to discover\\n\\nsomething.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, Tom. the firm he works for are good business men, and\\n\\nthey would not countenance anything like that. They are\\n\\nheartless competitors, however, and if they saw a legitimate\\n\\nchance to get ahead of me and take advantage, they would do\\n\\nit. But they would not sneak in to steal my ideas. I feel\\n\\nsure of that. Besides, they have a certain type of submarine\\n\\nwhich they think is the best ever invented, and they would\\n\\nhardly change at this late day. They feel sure of winning\\n\\nthe Government prize, and I\\'m just as glad we\\'re not going\\n\\nto have a contest.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Do you think our boat is better than theirs?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Much better, in many respects.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t like that man Berg, though,\" went on Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Nor do I,\" added his father. \"There is something strange\\n\\nabout him.  He was very anxious that I should compete.\\n\\nProbably he thought his firm\\'s boat would go so far ahead of\\n\\nours that they would get an extra bonus. But I\\'m glad he\\n\\ndidn\\'t see our new method of propulsion. That is the\\n\\nprincipal improvement in the Advance over other types of\\n\\nsubmarines. Well, another week and we will be ready for the\\n\\ntest.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Have you known Mr. Berg long, dad?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not very. I met him in Washington when I was in the\\n\\npatent office. He was taking out papers on a submarine for\\n\\nhis firm at the same time I got mine for the Advance. It is\\n\\nrather curious that he should come all the way here from\\n\\nPhiladelphia. merely to see if I was going to compete. There\\n\\nis something strange about it, something that I can\\'t\\n\\nunderstand.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe time was to come when Mr. Swift and his son were to\\n\\nget at the bottom of Mr. Berg\\'s reasons, and they learned to\\n\\ntheir sorrow that he had penetrated some of their secrets.\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore going to bed that night Tom and Mr. Sharp paid a\\n\\nvisit to the shed where the submarine was resting on the\\n\\nways, ready for launching. They found Mr. Jackson on guard\\n\\nand the engineer said that no one had been around. Nor was\\n\\nanything found disturbed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It certainly is a great machine,\" remarked the lad as he\\n\\nlooked up at the cigar-shaped bulk towering over his head.\\n\\n\"Dad has outdone himself this trip.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It looks all right,\" commented Mr. Sharp. \"Whether it\\n\\nwill work is another question.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, we can\\'t tell until it\\'s in the water,\" con ceded\\n\\nTom. \"But I hope it does. Dad has spent much time and money\\n\\non it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Advance was, as her name indicated, much in advance of\\n\\nprevious submarines. There was not so much difference in\\n\\noutward construction as there was in the means of propulsion\\n\\nand in the manner in which the interior and the machinery\\n\\nwere arranged.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe submarine planned by Mr. Swift and Tom jointly, and\\n\\nconstructed by them, with the aid of Mr. Sharp and Mr.\\n\\nJackson, was shaped like a Cigar, over one hundred feet long\\n\\nand twenty feet in diameter at the thickest part. It was\\n\\ndivided into many compartments, all water-tight, so that if\\n\\none or even three were flooded the ship would still be\\n\\nuseable.\\n\\n\\n\\nBuoyancy was provided for by having several tanks for the\\n\\nintroduction of compressed air, and there was an emergency\\n\\narrangement so that a collapsible aluminum container could\\n\\nbe distended and filled with a powerful gas. This was to be\\n\\nused if, by any means, the ship was disabled on the bottom\\n\\nof the ocean. The container could be expanded and filled,\\n\\nand would send the Advance to the surface.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother peculiar feature was that the engine-room, dynamos\\n\\nand other apparatus were all contained amidships. This gave\\n\\nstability to the craft, and also enabled the same engine to\\n\\noperate both shafts and propellers, as well as both the\\n\\nnegative forward electrical plates, and the positive rear\\n\\nones.\\n\\n\\n\\nThese plates were a new idea in submarine construction,\\n\\nand were the outcome of an idea of Mr. Swift, with some\\n\\nsuggestions from his son.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe aged inventor did not want to depend on the usual\\n\\nscrew propellers for his craft, nor did he want to use a jet\\n\\nof compressed air, shooting out from a rear tube, nor yet a\\n\\njet of water, by means of which the creature called the\\n\\nsquid shoots himself along. Mr. Swift planned to send the\\n\\nAdvance along under water by means of electricity.\\n\\n\\n\\nCertain peculiar plates were built at the forward and aft\\n\\nblunt noses of the submarine. Into the forward plate a\\n\\nnegative charge of electricity was sent, and into the one at\\n\\nthe rear a positive charge, just as one end of a horseshoe\\n\\nmagnet is positive and will repel the north end of a compass\\n\\nneedle, while the other pole of a magnet is negative and\\n\\nwill attract it. In electricity like repels like, while\\n\\nnegative and positive have a mutual attraction for each\\n\\nother.\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Swift figured out that if he could send a powerful\\n\\ncurrent of negative electricity into the forward plate it\\n\\nwould pull the boat along, for water is a good conductor of\\n\\nelectricity, while if a positive charge was sent into the\\n\\nrear plate it would serve to push the submarine along, and\\n\\nhe would thus get a pulling and pushing motion, just as a\\n\\nforward and aft propeller works on some ferry boats.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the inventor did not depend on these plates alone.\\n\\nThere were auxiliary forward and aft propellers of the\\n\\nregular type, so that if the electrical plates did not work,\\n\\nor got out of order, the screws would serve to send the\\n\\nAdvance along.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was much machinery in the submarine There were\\n\\ngasolene motors, since space was too cramped to allow the\\n\\ncarrying of coal for boilers. There were dynamos, motors and\\n\\npowerful pumps. Some of these were for air, and some for\\n\\nwater. To sink the submarine below the surface large tanks\\n\\nwere filled with water. To insure a more sudden descent,\\n\\ndeflecting rudders were also used, similar to those on an\\n\\nairship. There were also special air pumps, and one for the\\n\\npowerful gas, which was manufactured on board.\\n\\n\\n\\nForward from the engine-room was a cabin, where meals\\n\\ncould be served, and where the travelers could remain in the\\n\\ndaytime. There was also a small cooking galley, or kitchen,\\n\\nthere. Back of the engine-room were the sleeping quarters\\n\\nand the storerooms. The submarine was steered from the\\n\\nforward compartment, and here were also levers, wheels and\\n\\nvalves that controlled all the machinery, while a number of\\n\\ndials showed in which direction they were going, how deep\\n\\nthey were, and at what speed they were moving, as well as\\n\\nwhat the ocean pressure was.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn top, forward, was a small conning, or observation\\n\\ntower, with auxiliary and steering and controlling apparatus\\n\\nthere. This was to be used when the ship was moving along\\n\\non the surface of the ocean, or merely with the deck awash.\\n\\nThere was a small flat deck surrounding the conning tower\\n\\nand this was available when the craft was on the surface.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was provision made for leaving the ship when it was\\n\\non the bed of the ocean. When it was desired to do this the\\n\\noccupants put on diving suits, which were provided with\\n\\nportable oxygen tanks. Then they entered a chamber into\\n\\nwhich water was admitted until it was equal in pressure to\\n\\nthat outside. Then a steel door was opened, and they could\\n\\nstep out. To re-enter the ship the operation was reversed.\\n\\nThis was not a new feature. In fact, many submarines to-day\\n\\nuse it\\n\\n\\n\\nAt certain places there were thick bull\\'s-eye windows, by\\n\\nmeans of which the under-water travelers could look out into\\n\\nthe ocean through which they were moving. As a defense\\n\\nagainst the attacks of submarine monsters there was a steel,\\n\\npointed ram, like a big harpoon. There were also a bow and a\\n\\nstern electrical gun, of which more will be told later.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn addition to ample sleeping accommodations. there were\\n\\nmany conveniences aboard the Advance. Plenty of fresh water\\n\\ncould be carried, and there was an apparatus for distilling\\n\\nmore from the sea water that surrounded the travelers.\\n\\nCompressed air was carried in large tanks, and oxygen could\\n\\nbe made as needed. In short, nothing that could add to the\\n\\ncomfort or safety of the travelers had been omitted. There\\n\\nwas a powerful crane and windlass, which had been installed\\n\\nwhen Mr. Swift thought his boat might be bought by the\\n\\nGovernment. This was to be used for raising wrecks or\\n\\nrecovering objects from the bottom of the ocean. Ample\\n\\nstores and provisions were to be carried and, once the\\n\\ntravelers were shut up in the Advance, they could exist for\\n\\na month below the surface, providing no accident occurred.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll these things Tom and Mr. Sharp thought of as they\\n\\nlooked over the ship before turning in for the night. The\\n\\ncraft was made immensely strong to withstand powerful\\n\\npressure at the bottom of the ocean. The submarine could\\n\\npenetrate to a depth of about three miles. Below that it was\\n\\ndangerous to go, as the awful force would crush the plates,\\n\\npowerful as they were.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, we\\'ll rush things to-morrow and the next day,\"\\n\\nobserved Tom as he prepared to leave the building. \"Then\\n\\nwe\\'ll soon see if it works.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the next week there were busy times in the shop near\\n\\nthe ocean. Great secrecy was maintained, and though\\n\\ncuriosity seekers did stroll along now and then, they\\n\\nreceived little satisfaction. At first Mr. Swift thought\\n\\nthat the visit of Mr. Berg would have unpleasant results,\\n\\nfor he feared that the agent would talk about the craft, of\\n\\nwhich he had so unexpectedly gotten a sight. But nothing\\n\\nseemed to follow from his chance inspection, and it was\\n\\nforgotten.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was one evening, about a week later, that Tom was alone\\n\\nin the shop. The two mechanics that had been hired to help\\n\\nout in the rush had been let go, and the ship needed but a\\n\\nfew adjustments to make it ready for the sea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I think I\\'ll just take another look at the water tank\\n\\nvalves,\" said Tom to himself as he prepared to enter the big\\n\\ncompartments which received the water ballast. \"I want to be\\n\\nsure they work properly and quickly. We\\'ve got to depend on\\n\\nthem to make us sink when we want to, and, what\\'s more\\n\\nimportant, to rise to the surface in a hurry. I\\'ve got time\\n\\nenough to look them over before dad and Mr. Sharp get back.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom entered the starboard tank by means of an emergency\\n\\nsliding door between the big compartments and the main part\\n\\nof the ship. This was closed by a worm and screw gear, and\\n\\nonce the ship was in the water would seldom be used.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe young inventor proceeded with his task, carefully\\n\\ninspecting the valves by the light of a lantern he carried.\\n\\nThe apparatus seemed to be all right, and Tom was about to\\n\\nleave when a peculiar noise attracted his attention. It was\\n\\nthe sound of metal scraping on metal, and the lad\\'s quick\\n\\nand well-trained ear told him it was somewhere about the\\n\\nship.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe turned to leave the tank, but as he wheeled around his\\n\\nlight flashed on a solid wall of steel back of him. The\\n\\nemergency outlet had been closed! He was a prisoner in the\\n\\nwater compartment, and he knew, from past experience, that\\n\\nshout as he would, his voice could not be heard ten feet\\n\\naway. His father and Mr. Sharp, as he was aware, had gone to\\n\\na nearby city for some tools, and Mr. Jackson, the engineer,\\n\\nwas temporarily away. Mrs. Baggert, in the house, could not\\n\\nhear his cries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m locked in!\" cried Tom aloud. \"The worm gear must have\\n\\nshut of itself. But I don\\'t see how that could be. I\\'ve got\\n\\nto get out mighty soon, though, or I\\'ll smother. This tank\\n\\nis airtight, and it won\\'t take me long to breath up all the\\n\\noxygen there is here. I must get that slide open.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe sought to grasp the steel plate that closed the\\n\\nemergency opening. His fingers slipped over the smooth,\\n\\npolished surface. He was hermetically sealed up--a captive!\\n\\nBlankly he set his lantern down and leaned hopelessly\\n\\nagainst the wall of the tank.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got to get out,\" he murmured.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs if in answer to him he heard a voice on the outside,\\n\\ncrying:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There, Tom Swift! I guess I\\'ve gotten even with you now!\\n\\nMaybe next time you won\\'t take a reward away from me, and\\n\\nlick me into the bargain. I\\'ve got you shut up good and\\n\\ntight, and you\\'ll stay there until I get ready to let you\\n\\nout.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Andy Foger!\" gasped Tom. \"Andy Foger sneaked in here and\\n\\nturned the gear. But how did he get to this part of the\\n\\ncoast? Andy Foger, you let me out!\" shouted the young\\n\\ninventor; and as Andy\\'s mocking laugh came to him faintly\\n\\nthrough the steel sides of the submarine, the imprisoned lad\\n\\nbeat desperately with his hands on the smooth sides of the\\n\\ntank, vainly wondering how his enemy had discovered him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Five\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Berg is Suspicious\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNot for long did the young inventor endeavor to break his\\n\\nway out of the water-ballast tank by striking the heavy\\n\\nsides of it. Tom realized that this was worse than useless.\\n\\nHe listened intently, but could hear nothing. Even the\\n\\nretreating footsteps of Andy Foger were inaudible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"This certainly is a pickle!\" exclaimed Tom aloud. \"I\\n\\ncan\\'t understand how he ever got here. He must have traced\\n\\nus after we went to Shopton in the airship the last time.\\n\\nThen he sneaked in here. Probably he saw me enter, but how\\n\\ncould he knew enough to work the worm gear and close the\\n\\ndoor? Andy has had some experience with machinery, though,\\n\\nand one of the vaults in the bank where his father is a\\n\\ndirector closed just like this tank. That\\'s very likely how\\n\\nhe learned about it. But I\\'ve got to do something else\\n\\nbesides thinking of that sneak, Andy. I\\'ve got to get out of\\n\\nhere. Let\\'s see if I can work the gear from inside.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore he started, almost, Tom knew that it would be\\n\\nimpossible. The tank was made to close from the interior of\\n\\nthe submarine, and the heavy door, built to withstand the\\n\\npressure of tons of water, could not be forced except by the\\n\\nproper means.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No use trying that,\" concluded the lad, after a tiring\\n\\nattempt to force back the sliding door with his hands. \"I\\'ve\\n\\ngot to call for help.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe shouted until the vibrations in the confined space made\\n\\nhis ears ring, and the mere exertion of raising his voice to\\n\\nthe highest pitch made his heart beat quickly. Yet there\\n\\ncame no response. He hardly expected that there would be\\n\\nany, for with his father and Mr. Sharp away, the engineer\\n\\nabsent on an errand, and Mrs. Baggert in the house some\\n\\ndistance off, there was no one to hear his calls for help,\\n\\neven if they had been capable of penetrating farther than\\n\\nthe extent of the shed, where the under-water craft had been\\n\\nconstructed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got to wait until some of them come out here,\"\\n\\nthought Tom. \"They\\'ll be sure to release me and make a\\n\\nsearch. Then it will be easy enough to call to them and tell\\n\\nthem where I am, once they are inside the shed. But--\" He\\n\\npaused, for a horrible fear came over him. \"Suppose they\\n\\nshould come--too late?\" The tank was airtight. There was\\n\\nenough air in it to last for some time, but, sooner or\\n\\nlater, it would no longer support life. Already, Tom\\n\\nthought, it seemed oppressive, though probably that was his\\n\\nimagination.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I must get out!\" he repeated frantically. \"I\\'ll die in\\n\\nhere soon.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAgain he tried to shove back the steel door. Then he\\n\\nrepeated his cries until be was weary. No one answered him.\\n\\nHe fancied once he could hear footsteps in the shed, and\\n\\nthought, perhaps, it was Andy, come back to gloat over him.\\n\\nThen Tom knew the red-haired coward would not dare venture\\n\\nback. We must do Andy the justice to say that he never\\n\\nrealized that he was endangering Tom\\'s life. The bully had\\n\\nno idea the tank was airtight when he closed it. He had seen\\n\\nTom enter and a sudden whim came to him to revenge himself.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut that did not help the young inventor any. There was no\\n\\ndoubt about it now--the air was becoming close. Tom had been\\n\\nimprisoned nearly two hours, and as he was a healthy, strong\\n\\nlad, he required plenty of oxygen. There was certainly less\\n\\nthan there had been in the tank. His head began to buzz, and\\n\\nthere was a ringing in his ears.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce more he fell upon his knees, and his fingers sought\\n\\nthe small projections of the gear on the inside of the door\\n\\nHe could no more budge the mechanism than a child could open\\n\\na burglar-proof vault.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s no use,\" he moaned, and he sprawled at full length\\n\\non the floor of the tank, for there the air was purer. As he\\n\\ndid so his fingers touched something. He started as they\\n\\nclosed around the handle of a big monkey wrench. It was one\\n\\nhe had brought into the place with him. Imbued with new hope\\n\\nbe struck a match and lighted his lantern, which he had\\n\\nallowed to go out as it burned up too much of the oxygen. By\\n\\nthe gleam of it he looked to see if there were any bolts or\\n\\nnuts he could loosen with the wrench, in order to slide the\\n\\ndoor back. It needed but a glance to show him the futility\\n\\nof this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s no go,\" he murmured, and he let the wrench fall to\\n\\nthe floor. There was a ringing, clanging sound, and as it\\n\\nsmote his ears Tom sprang up with an exclamation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s the thing!\" he cried. \"I wonder I didn\\'t think of\\n\\nit before. I can signal for help by pounding on the sides of\\n\\nthe tank with the wrench. The blows will carry a good deal\\n\\nfarther than my voice would.\" Every one knows how far the\\n\\nnoise of a boiler shop, with hammers falling on steel\\n\\nplates, can be heard; much farther than can a human voice.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom began a lusty tattoo on the metal sides of the tank.\\n\\nAt first he merely rattled out blow after blow, and then, as\\n\\nanother thought came to him, he adopted a certain plan. Some\\n\\ntime previous, when he and Mr. Sharp had planned their trip\\n\\nin the air, the two had adopted a code of signals. As it was\\n\\ndifficult in a high wind to shout from one end of the\\n\\nairship to the other, the young inventor would sometimes\\n\\npound on the pipe which ran from the pilot house of the Red\\n\\nCloud to the engine-room. By a combination of numbers,\\n\\nsimple messages could be conveyed. The code included a call\\n\\nfor help. Forty-seven was the number, but there had never\\n\\nbeen any occasion to use it.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom remembered this now. At once he ceased his\\n\\nindiscriminate hammering, and began to beat out regularly--\\n\\none, two, three, four--then a pause, and seven blows would\\n\\nbe given. Over and over again he rang out this number--forty\\n\\nseven--the call for help.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If Mr. Sharp only comes back he will hear that, even in\\n\\nthe house,\" thought poor Tom \"Maybe Garret or Mrs. Baggert\\n\\nwill hear it, too, but they won\\'t know what it means.\\n\\nThey\\'ll think I\\'m just working on the submarine.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIt seemed several hours to Tom that he pounded out that\\n\\ncry for aid, but, as he afterward learned, it was only a\\n\\nlittle over an hour. Signal after signal he sent vibrating\\n\\nfrom the steel sides of the tank. When one arm tired he\\n\\nwould use the other. He grew weary, his head was aching, and\\n\\nthere was a ringing in his ears; a ringing that seemed as if\\n\\nten thousand bells were jangling out their peals, and he\\n\\ncould barely distinguish his own pounding.\\n\\n\\n\\nSignal after signal he sounded. It was becoming like a\\n\\ndream to him, when suddenly, as he paused for a rest, he\\n\\nheard his name called faintly, as if far away.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Tom! Tom! Where are you?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was the voice of Mr. Sharp. Then followed the tones of\\n\\nthe aged inventor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"My poor boy! Tom, are you still alive?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, dad! In the starboard tank!\" the lad gasped out, and\\n\\nthen he lost his senses. When he revived he was lying on a\\n\\npile of bagging in the submarine shop, and his father and\\n\\nthe aeronaut were bending over him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Are you all right, Tom?\" asked Mr. Swift.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes--I--I guess so,\" was the hesitating answer. \"Yes,\"\\n\\nthe lad added, as the fresh air cleared his head. \"I\\'ll be\\n\\nall right pretty soon. Have you seen Andy Foger?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Did he shut you in there?\" demanded Mr. Swift.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll have him arrested!\" declared Mr. Swift \"I\\'ll go to\\n\\ntown as soon as you\\'re in good shape again and notify the\\n\\npolice.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, don\\'t,\" pleaded Tom. \"I\\'ll take care of Andy myself.\\n\\nI don\\'t really believe he knew how serious it was. I\\'ll\\n\\nsettle with him later, though.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, it came mighty near being serious,\" remarked Mr.\\n\\nSharp grimly. \"Your father and I came back a little sooner\\n\\nthan we expected, and as soon as I got near the house I\\n\\nheard your signal. I knew what it was in a moment. There\\n\\nwere Mrs. Baggert and Garret talking away, and when I asked\\n\\nthem why they didn\\'t answer your call they said they thought\\n\\nyou were merely tinkering with the machinery. But I knew\\n\\nbetter. It\\'s the first time we ever had a use for \\'forty-\\n\\nseven,\\' Tom.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And I hope it will be the last,\" replied the young\\n\\ninventor with a faint smile. \"But I\\'d like to know what Andy\\n\\nFoger is doing in this neighborhood.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom was soon himself again and able to go to the house,\\n\\nwhere he found Mrs. Baggert brewing a big basin of catnip\\n\\ntea, under the impression that it would in some way be good\\n\\nfor his. She could not forgive herself for not having\\n\\nanswered his signal, and as for Mr. Jackson, he had started\\n\\nfor a doctor as soon as he learned that Tom was shut up in\\n\\nthe tank. The services of the medical man were canceled by\\n\\ntelephone, as there was no need for him, and the engineer\\n\\ncame back to the house.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom was fully himself the next day, and aided his father\\n\\nand Mr. Sharp in putting the finishing touches to the\\n\\nAdvance. It was found that some alteration was required in\\n\\nthe auxiliary propellers, and this, much to the regret of\\n\\nthe young inventor, would necessitate postponing the trial a\\n\\nfew days.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But we\\'ll have her in the water next Friday.\" promised\\n\\nMr. Swift.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Aren\\'t you superstitious about Friday?\" asked the\\n\\nballoonist.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not a bit of it,\" replied the aged inventor. \"Tom,\" he\\n\\nadded, \"I wish you would go in the house and get me the roll\\n\\nof blueprints you\\'ll find on my desk.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the lad neared the cottage he saw, standing in front of\\n\\nthe place, a small automobile. A man had just descended\\n\\nfrom it, and it needed but a glance to show that he was Mr.\\n\\nAddison Berg.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ah, good morning, Mr. Swift,\" greeted Mr. Berg. \"I wish\\n\\nto see your father, but as I don\\'t wish to lay myself open\\n\\nto suspicions by entering the shop, perhaps you will ask him\\n\\nto step here.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" answered the lad, wondering why the agent had\\n\\nreturned. Getting the blueprints, and asking Mr. Berg to sit\\n\\ndown on the porch, Tom delivered the message.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You come back with me, Tom,\" said his father. \"I want you\\n\\nto be a witness to what he says. I\\'m not going to get into\\n\\ntrouble with these people.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Berg came to the point at once.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Mr. Swift,\" he said, \"I wish you would reconsider your\\n\\ndetermination not to enter the Government trials. I\\'d like\\n\\nto see you compete. So would my firm.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There is no use going over that again,\" replied the aged\\n\\ninventor. \"I have another object in view now than trying for\\n\\nthe Government prize. What it is I can\\'t say, but it may\\n\\ndevelop in time--if we are successful,\" and he looked at\\n\\nhis son, smiling the while.\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Berg tried to argue, but it was of no avail Then he\\n\\nchanged his manner, and said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, since you won\\'t, you won\\'t, I suppose. I\\'ll go back\\n\\nand report to my firm.  Have you anything special to do this\\n\\nmorning?\" he went on to Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I can always find something to keep me busy,\"\\n\\nreplied the lad, \"but as for anything special--\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I thought perhaps you\\'d like to go for a trip in my\\n\\nauto,\" interrupted Mr. Berg. \"I had asked a young man who is\\n\\nstopping at the same hotel where I am to accompany me, but\\n\\nhe has unexpectedly left, and I don\\'t like to go alone. His\\n\\nname was--let me see. I have a wretched memory for names,\\n\\nbut it was something like Roger or Moger.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Foger!\" cried Tom. \"Was it Andy Foger?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, that was it. Why, do you know him?\" asked Mr. Berg\\n\\nin some surprise.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I should say so,\" replied Tom. \"He was the cause of what\\n\\nmight have resulted in something serious for me,\" and the\\n\\nlad explained about being imprisoned in the tank.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You don\\'t tell me!\" cried Mr. Berg. \"I had no idea he was\\n\\nthat kind of a lad. You see, his father is one of the\\n\\ndirectors of the firm by whom I am employed. Andy came from\\n\\nhome to spend a few weeks at the seaside, and stopped at the\\n\\nsame hotel that I did. He went off yesterday afternoon, and\\n\\nI haven\\'t seen him since, though he promised to go for a\\n\\nride with me. He must have come over here and entered your\\n\\nshop unobserved. I remember now he asked me where the\\n\\nsubmarine was being built that was going to compete with our\\n\\nfirm\\'s, and I told him. I didn\\'t think he was that kind of\\n\\na lad. Well, since he\\'s probably gone back home, perhaps you\\n\\nwill come for a ride with me, Tom.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid I can\\'t go, thank you,\" answered the lad. \"We\\n\\nare very busy getting our submarine in shape for a trial.\\n\\nBut I can imagine why Andy left so hurriedly. He probably\\n\\nlearned that a doctor had been summoned for me, though, as\\n\\nit happened, I didn\\'t need one. But Andy probably got\\n\\nfrightened at what he had done, and left. I\\'ll make him\\n\\nmore sorry, when I meet him.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Don\\'t blame you a bit,\" commented Mr. Berg. \"Well, I must\\n\\nbe getting back.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe hastened out to his auto, while Tom and his father\\n\\nwatched the agent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Tom, never trust that man,\" advised the aged inventor\\n\\nsolemnly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Just what I was about to remark,\" said his son. \"Well,\\n\\nlet\\'s get back to work. Queer that he should come here\\n\\nagain, and it\\'s queer about Andy Foger.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFather and son returned to the machine shop, while Mr.\\n\\nBerg puffed away in his auto. A little later, Tom having\\n\\noccasion to go to a building near the boundary line of the\\n\\ncottage property which his father had hired for the season,\\n\\nsaw, through the hedge that bordered it, an automobile\\n\\nstanding in the road. A second glance showed him that it was\\n\\nMr. Berg\\'s machine. Something had gone wrong with it, and\\n\\nthe agent had alighted to make an adjustment.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe young inventor was close to the man, though the latter\\n\\nwas unaware of his presence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hang it all!\" Tom heard Mr. Berg exclaim to himself. \"I\\n\\nwonder what they can be up to? They won\\'t enter the\\n\\nGovernment contests, and they won\\'t say why. I believe\\n\\nthey\\'re up to some game, and I\\'ve got to find out what it\\n\\nis. I wonder if I couldn\\'t use this Foger chap?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He seems to have it in for this Tom Swift,\" Mr. Berg went\\n\\non, still talking to himself, though not so low but that Tom\\n\\ncould hear him. \"I think I\\'ll try it. I\\'ll get Andy Foger to\\n\\nsneak around and find out what the game is. He\\'ll do it, I\\n\\nknow.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBy this time the auto was in working order again, and the\\n\\nagent took his seat and started off.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So that\\'s how matters lie, eh?\" thought Tom. \"Well, Mr.\\n\\nBerg, we\\'ll be doubly on the lookout for you after this. As\\n\\nfor Andy Foger, I think I\\'ll make him wish he\\'d never locked\\n\\nme in that tank. So you expect to find out our \\'game,\\' eh,\\n\\nMr. Berg? Well, when you do know it, I think it will\\n\\nastonish you. I only hope you don\\'t learn what it is until\\n\\nwe get at that sunken treasure, though.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut alas for Tom\\'s hopes. Mr. Berg did learn of the object\\n\\nof the treasure-seekers, and sought to defeat them, as we\\n\\nshall learn as our story proceeds.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Six\\n\\n\\n\\nTurning the Tables\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the young inventor informed his father what he had\\n\\noverheard Mr. Berg saying, the aged inventor was not as much\\n\\nworried as his son anticipated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"All we\\'ll have to do, Tom,\" he said, \"is to keep quiet\\n\\nabout where we are going. Once we have the Advance afloat,\\n\\nand try her out, we can start on our voyage for the South\\n\\nAmerican Coast and search for the sunken treasure. When we\\n\\nbegin our voyage under water I defy any one to tell where we\\n\\nare going, or what our plans are. No, I don\\'t believe we\\n\\nneed worry about Mr. Berg, though he probably means\\n\\nmischief.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m going to keep my eyes open for him and Andy\\n\\nFoger,\" declared Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe days that followed were filled with work. Not only\\n\\nwere there many unexpected things to do about the submarine,\\n\\nbut Mr. Sharp was kept busy making inquiries about the\\n\\nsunken treasure ship. These inquiries had to he made\\n\\ncarefully, as the adventurers did not want their plans\\n\\ntalked of, and nothing circulates more quickly than rumors\\n\\nof an expedition after treasure of any kind.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What about the old sea captain you were going to get to\\n\\ngo with us?\" asked Mr. Swift of the balloonist one afternoon.\\n\\n\"Have you succeeded in finding one yet?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes; I am in communication with a man think will be just\\n\\nthe person for us. His name is Captain Alden Weston, and he\\n\\nhas sailed all over the world. He has also taken part in\\n\\nmore than one revolution, and, in fact, is a soldier of\\n\\nfortune. I do not know him personally, but a friend of mine\\n\\nknows him, and says he will serve us faithfully. I have\\n\\nwritten to him, and he will he here in a few days.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s good. Now about the location of the wreck itself.\\n\\nHave you been able to learn any more details?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, not many. You see, the Boldero was abandoned in a\\n\\nstorm, and the captain did not take very careful\\n\\nobservations. As nearly as it can be figured out the\\n\\ntreasure ship went to the bottom in latitude forty-five\\n\\ndegrees south, and longitude twenty-seven east from\\n\\nWashington. That\\'s a pretty indefinite location, but I hope,\\n\\nonce we get off the Uruguay coast, we can better it. We can\\n\\nanchor or lay outside the harbor, and in the small boat we\\n\\ncarry go ashore and possibly gain more details. For it was\\n\\nat Montevideo that the shipwrecked passengers and sailors\\n\\nlanded.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Does Captain Weston know our object?\" inquired Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, and I don\\'t propose to tell him until we are ready to\\n\\nstart,\" replied Mr. Sharp. \"I don\\'t know just how he\\'ll\\n\\nconsider a submarine trip after treasure, but if I spring it\\n\\non him suddenly he\\'s less likely to back out. Oh, I think\\n\\nhe\\'ll go.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSomewhat unexpectedly the next day it was discovered that\\n\\ncertain tools and appliances were needed for the submarine,\\n\\nand they had been left in the house at Shopton, where\\n\\nEradicate Sampson was in charge as caretaker during the\\n\\nabsence of Mr. Swift and his son and the housekeeper.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I suppose we\\'ll have to go back after them,\"\\n\\nremarked Tom. \"We\\'ll take the airship, dad, and make a two-\\n\\ndays\\' trip of it. Is there anything else you want?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, you might bring a bundle of papers you\\'ll find in\\n\\nthe lower right hand drawer of my desk. They contain some\\n\\nmemoranda I need.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom and Mr. Sharp had become so used to traveling in the\\n\\nairship that it seemed no novelty to them, though they\\n\\nattracted much attention wherever they went. They soon had\\n\\nthe Red Cloud in readiness for a flight, and rising in the\\n\\nair above the shop that contained the powerful submarine, a\\n\\ncraft utterly different in type from the aeroplane, the nose\\n\\nof the airship was pointed toward Shopton.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey made a good flight and landed near the big shed where\\n\\nthe bird of the air was kept. It was early evening when they\\n\\ngot to the Swift homestead, and Eradicate Sampson was glad\\n\\nto see them.\\n\\n\\n\\nEradicate was a good cook, and soon had a meal ready for\\n\\nthe travelers. Then, while Mr. Sharp selected the tools and\\n\\nother things needed, and put them in the airship ready for\\n\\nthe start back the next morning, Tom concluded he would take\\n\\na stroll into Shopton, to see if he could see his friend,\\n\\nNed Newton. It was early evening, and the close of a\\n\\nbeautiful day, a sharp shower in the morning having cooled\\n\\nthe air.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom was greeted by a number of acquaintances as he\\n\\nstrolled along, for, since the episode of the bank robbery,\\n\\nwhen he had so unexpectedly returned with the thieves and\\n\\nthe cash, the lad was better known than ever.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I guess Ned must be home\" thought our hero as he looked\\n\\nin vain for his chum among the throng on the streets. \"I\\'ve\\n\\ngot time to take a stroll down to his house.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom was about to cross the street when he was startled by\\n\\nthe sound of an automobile horn loudly blown just at his\\n\\nside. Then a voice called:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hey, there! Git out of the way if you don\\'t want to be\\n\\nrun over!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe looked up, and saw a car careening along. At the wheel\\n\\nwas the red-haired bully, Andy Foger, and in the tonneau\\n\\nwere Sam Snedecker and Pete Bailey.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Git out of the way,\" added Sam, and he grinned\\n\\nmaliciously at Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe latter stepped back, well out of the path of the car,\\n\\nwhich was not moving very fast. Just in front of Tom was a\\n\\npuddle of muddy water. There was no necessity for Andy\\n\\nsteering into it, but he saw his opportunity, and a moment\\n\\nlater one of the big pneumatic tires had plunged into the\\n\\ndirty fluid, spattering it all over Tom, some even going as\\n\\nhigh as his face.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ha! ha!\" laughed Andy. \"Maybe you\\'ll get out of my way\\n\\nnext time, Tom Swift.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe young inventor was almost speechless from righteous\\n\\nanger. He wiped the mud from his face, glanced down at his\\n\\nclothes, which were all but ruined, and called out:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hold on there, Andy Foger! I want to see you!\" for he\\n\\nthought of the time when Andy had shut him in the tank.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ta! ta!\" shouted Pete Bailey.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"See you later,\" added Sam.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Better go home and take a bath, and then sail away in\\n\\nyour submarine,\" went on Andy. \"I\\'ll bet it will sink.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore Tom could reply the auto had turned a corner.\\n\\nDisgusted and angry, he tried to sop up some of the muddy\\n\\nwater with his handkerchief. While thus engaged he heard his\\n\\nname called, and looked up to see Ned Newton.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter? Fall down?\" asked his chum.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Andy Foger,\" replied Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s enough,\" retorted Ned. \"I can guess the rest.\\n\\nWe\\'ll have to tar and feather him some day, and ride him out\\n\\nof town on a rail. I\\'d kick him myself, only his father is a\\n\\ndirector in the bank where I work, and I\\'d be fired if I\\n\\ndid. Can\\'t afford any such pleasure. But some day I\\'ll give\\n\\nAndy a good trouncing, and then resign before they can\\n\\ndischarge me. But I\\'ll be looking for another job before I\\n\\ndo that. Come on to my house, Tom, and I\\'ll help you clean\\n\\nup.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom was a little more presentable when he left his chum\\'s\\n\\nresidence, after spending the evening there, but he was\\n\\nstill burning for revenge against Andy and his cronies. He\\n\\nhad half a notion to go to Andy\\'s house and tell Mr. Foger\\n\\nhow nearly serious the bully\\'s prank at the sub marine had\\n\\nbeen, but be concluded that Mr. Foger could only uphold his\\n\\nson. \"No, I\\'ll settle with him myself,\" decided Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\nBidding Eradicate keep a watchful eye about the house, and\\n\\nleaving word for Mr. Damon to be sure to come to the coast\\n\\nif he again called at the Shopton house, Tom and Mr. Sharp\\n\\nprepared to make their return trip early the next morning.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe gas tank was filled and the Red Cloud arose in the\\n\\nair. Then, with the propellers moving at moderate speed, the\\n\\nnose of the craft was pointed toward the New Jersey coast.\\n\\n\\n\\nA few miles out from Shopton, finding there was a contrary\\n\\nwind in the upper regions where they were traveling, Mr.\\n\\nSharp descended several hundred feet. They were moving over\\n\\na sparsely settled part of the country, and looking down,\\n\\nTom saw, speeding along a highway, an automobile.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I wonder who\\'s in it?\" he remarked, taking down a\\n\\ntelescope and peering over the window ledge of the cabin.\\n\\nThe next moment he uttered a startled exclamation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Andy  Foger, Sam  Snedecker and Pete Bailey!\" he cried.\\n\\n\"Oh, I wish I had a bucket of water to empty on them.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I know a better way to get even with them than that,\"\\n\\nsaid Mr. Sharp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"How?\" asked Tom eagerly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll show you,\" replied the balloonist. \"It\\'s a trick I\\n\\nonce played on a fellow who did me an injury. Here, you\\n\\nsteer for a minute until I get the thing fixed, then I\\'ll\\n\\ntake charge.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Sharp went to the storeroom and came back with a long,\\n\\nstout rope and a small anchor of four prongs. It was carried\\n\\nto be used in emergencies, but so far had never been called\\n\\ninto requisition. Fastening the grapple to the cable, the\\n\\nballoonist said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Now, Tom, they haven\\'t seen you. You stand in the stern\\n\\nand pay out the rope. I\\'ll steer the airship, and what I\\n\\nwant you to do is to catch the anchor in the rear of their\\n\\ncar. Then I\\'ll show you some fun.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom followed instructions. Slowly he lowered the rope with\\n\\nthe dangling grapple. The airship was also sent down, as the\\n\\ncable was not quite long enough to reach the earth from the\\n\\nheight at which they were. The engine was run at slow speed,\\n\\nso that the noise would not attract the attention of the\\n\\nthree cronies who were speeding along, all unconscious of\\n\\nthe craft in the air over their heads. The Red Cloud was\\n\\nmoving in the same direction as was the automobile.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe anchor was now close to the rear of Andy\\'s car.\\n\\nSuddenly it caught on the tonneau and Tom called that fact\\n\\nto Mr. Sharp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Fasten the rope at the cleat,\" directed the balloonist.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom did so, and a moment later the aeronaut sent the\\n\\nairship up by turning more gas into the container. At the\\n\\nsame time he reversed the engine and the Red Cloud began\\n\\npulling the touring car backward, also lifting the rear\\n\\nwheels clear from the earth.\\n\\n\\n\\nA startled cry from the occupants of the machine told Tom\\n\\nand his friend that Andy and his cronies were aware\\n\\nsomething was wrong. A moment later Andy, looking up, saw\\n\\nthe airship hovering in the air above him. Then he saw the\\n\\nrope fast to his auto. The airship was not rising now, or\\n\\nthe auto would have been turned over, but it was slowly\\n\\npulling it backward, in spite of the fact that the motor of\\n\\nthe car was still going.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Here! You let go of me!\" cried Andy. \"I\\'ll have you\\n\\narrested if you damage my car.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Come up here and cut the rope.\" called Tom leaning over\\n\\nand looking down. He could enjoy the bully\\'s discomfiture.\\n\\nAs for Sam and Pete, they were much frightened, and cowered\\n\\ndown on the floor of the tonneau.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Maybe you\\'ll shut me in the tank again and splash mud on\\n\\nme!\" shouted Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe rear wheels of the auto were lifted still higher from\\n\\nthe ground, as Mr. Sharp turned on a little more gas. Andy\\n\\nwas not proof against this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh! oh!\" he cried. \"Please let me down, Tom. I\\'m awful\\n\\nsorry for what I did! I\\'ll never do it again! Please, please\\n\\nlet me down! Don\\'t You\\'ll tip me over!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe had shut off his motor now, and was frantically\\n\\nclinging to the steering wheel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Do you admit that you\\'re a sneak and a coward?\" asked\\n\\nTom, \"rubbing it in.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, yes!  Oh, please let me down!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Shall we?\" asked Tom of Mr. Sharp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied the balloonist. \"We can afford to lose the\\n\\nrope and anchor for the sake of turning the tables. Cut the\\n\\ncable.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom saw what was intended. Using a little hatchet, he\\n\\nsevered the rope with a single blow. With a crash that could\\n\\nbe heard up in the air where the Red Cloud hovered, the rear\\n\\nwheels of the auto dropped to the ground. Then came two loud\\n\\nreports.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Both tires busted!\" commented Mr. Sharp dryly, and Tom,\\n\\nlooking down, saw the trio of lads ruefully contemplating\\n\\nthe collapsed rubber of the rear wheels. The tables had been\\n\\neffectually turned on Andy Foger. His auto was disabled, and\\n\\nthe airship, with a graceful sweep, mounted higher and\\n\\nhigher, continuing on its way to the coast.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Seven\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Damon Will Go\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I guess they\\'ve had their lesson,\" remarked Tom, as\\n\\nhe took an observation through the telescope and saw Andy\\n\\nand his cronies hard at work trying to repair the ruptured\\n\\ntires. \"That certainly was a corking good trick.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes,\" admitted Mr. Sharp modestly. \"I once did something\\n\\nsimilar, only it was a horse and wagon instead of an auto.\\n\\nBut let\\'s try for another speed record. The conditions are\\n\\njust right.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThey arrived at the coast much sooner than they had dared\\n\\nto hope, the Red Cloud proving herself a veritable wonder.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe remainder of that day, and part of the next, was spent\\n\\nin working on the submarine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We\\'ll launch her day after to-morrow,\" declared Mr. Swift\\n\\nenthusiastically. \"Then to see whether my calculations are\\n\\nright or wrong.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It won\\'t be your fault if it doesn\\'t work,\" said his son.\\n\\n\"You certainly have done your best.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And so have you and Mr. Sharp and the others, for that\\n\\nmatter. Well, I have no doubt but that everything will be\\n\\nall right, Tom.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There!\" exclaimed Mr. Sharp the next morning, as he was\\n\\nadjusting a certain gage. \"I knew I\\'d forget something. That\\n\\nspecial brand of lubricating oil. I meant to bring it from\\n\\nShopton, and I didn\\'t.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Maybe I can get it in Atlantis,\" suggested Tom, naming\\n\\nthe coast city nearest to them. \"I\\'ll take a walk over. It\\n\\nisn\\'t far.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Will you? I\\'ll be glad to have you,\" resumed the\\n\\nballoonist. \"A gallon will be all we\\'ll need.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom was soon on his way. He had to walk, as the roads were\\n\\ntoo poor to permit him to use the motor-cycle, and the\\n\\nairship attracted too much attention to use on a short trip.\\n\\nHe was strolling along, when from the other side of a row of\\n\\nsand dunes, that lined the uncertain road to Atlantis, he\\n\\nheard some one speaking. At first the tones were not\\n\\ndistinct, but as the lad drew nearer to the voice he heard\\n\\nan exclamation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my gold-headed cane! I believe I\\'m lost. He said it\\n\\nwas out this way somewhere, bet I don\\'t see anything of it.\\n\\nIf I had that Eradicate Sampson here now I\\'d--bless my\\n\\nshoelaces I don\\'t know what I would do to him.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Mr. Damon! Mr. Damon!\" cried Tom. \"Is that you?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Me? Of course it\\'s me! Who else would it be?\" answered\\n\\nthe voice. \"But who are you. Why, bless my liver! If it\\n\\nisn\\'t Tom Swift!\" he cried. \"Oh, but I\\'m glad to see you! I\\n\\nwas afraid I was shipwrecked! Bless my gaiters, how are you,\\n\\nanyhow? How is your father? How is Mr. Sharp, and all the\\n\\nrest of them?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Pretty well. And you?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Me? Oh, I\\'m all right; only a trifle nervous. I called at\\n\\nyour house in Shopton yesterday, and Eradicate told me, as\\n\\nwell as he could, where you were located. I had nothing to\\n\\ndo, so I thought I\\'d take a run down here. But what\\'s this I\\n\\nhear about you? Are you going on a voyage?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"In the air? May I go along again? I certainly enjoyed my\\n\\nother trip in the Red Cloud. What is, all but the fire and\\n\\nbeing shot at. May I go?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We\\'re going on a different sort of trip this time,\" said\\n\\nthe youth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Where?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Under water.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Under water?  Bless my sponge bath! You don\\'t mean it!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes. Dad has completed the submarine he was working on\\n\\nwhen we were off in the airship, and it will be launched the\\n\\nday after to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, that\\'s so. I\\'d forgotten about it. He\\'s going to try\\n\\nfor the Government prize, isn\\'t he? But tell me more about\\n\\nit. Bless my scarf-pin, but I\\'m glad I met you! Going into\\n\\ntown, I take it. Well, I just came from there, but I\\'ll walk\\n\\nback with you. Do you think--is there any possibility --that\\n\\nI could go with you? Of course, I don\\'t want to crowd you,\\n\\nbut--\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, there\\'ll be plenty of room,\" replied the young\\n\\ninventor. \"In fact, more room than we had in the airship. We\\n\\nwere talking only the other day about the possibility of you\\n\\ngoing with us, but we didn\\'t think you\\'d risk it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Risk it? Bless my liver! Of course I\\'ll risk\\' it! It\\n\\ncan\\'t be as bad as sailing in the air. You can\\'t fall,\\n\\nthat\\'s certain.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No; but maybe you can\\'t rise,\" remarked Tom grimly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, we won\\'t think of that. Of course, I\\'d like to go. I\\n\\nfully expected to be killed in the Red Cloud, but as I\\n\\nwasn\\'t I\\'m ready to take a chance in the water. On the\\n\\nwhole, I think I prefer to be buried at sea, anyhow. Now,\\n\\nthen, will you take me?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I think I can safely promise,\" answered Tom with a smile\\n\\nat his friend\\'s enthusiasm.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe two were approaching the city, having walked along as\\n\\nthey talked. There were still some sand dunes near the road,\\n\\nand they kept on the side of these, nearest the beach, where\\n\\nthey could watch the breakers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But you haven\\'t told me where you are going,\" went on Mr.\\n\\nDamon, after blessing a few dozen objects. \"Where do the\\n\\nGovernment trials take place?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" replied the lad, \"to be frank with you, we have\\n\\nabandoned our intention of trying for the Government prize.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not going to try for it? Bless my slippers! Why not?\\n\\nIsn\\'t fifty thousand dollars worth striving for? And, with\\n\\nthe kind of a submarine you say you have, you ought to be\\n\\nable to win.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, probably we could win,\" admitted the young inventor,\\n\\n\"but we are going to try for a better prize.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"A better one? I don\\'t understand.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Sunken treasure,\" explained Tom. \"There\\'s a ship sunk off\\n\\nthe coast of Uruguay, with three hundred thousand dollars in\\n\\ngold bullion aboard. Dad and I are going to try to recover\\n\\nthat in our submarine. We\\'re going to start day after\\n\\nto-morrow, and, if you like, you may go along.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Go along! Of course I\\'ll go along!\" cried the eccentric\\n\\nman. \"But I never heard of such a thing. Sunken treasure!\\n\\nThree hundred thousand dollars in gold! My, what a lot of\\n\\nmoney! And to go after it in a submarine! It\\'s as good as a\\n\\nstory!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, we hope to recover all the treasure,\" said the lad.\\n\\n\"We ought to be able to claim at least half of it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my pocketbook!\" cried Mr. Damon, but Tom did not\\n\\nhear him. At that instant his attention was attracted by\\n\\nseeing two men emerge from behind the sand dune near which\\n\\nhe and Mr. Damon had halted momentarily, when the youth\\n\\nexplained about the treasure. The man looked sharply at Tom.\\n\\nA moment later the first man was joined by another, and at\\n\\nthe sight of him our hero could not repress an exclamation\\n\\nof alarm. For the second man was none other than Addison\\n\\nBerg.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe latter glanced quickly at Tom, and then, with a hasty\\n\\nword to his companion, the two swung around and made off in\\n\\nthe opposite direction to that in which they had been\\n\\nwalking.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" asked Mr. Damon, seeing the young\\n\\ninventor was strangely affected.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That--that man,\" stammered the lad.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You don\\'t mean to tell me that was one the Happy Harry\\n\\ngang, do you?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No. But one, or both of those men, may prove to be worse.\\n\\nThat second man was Addison Berg, and he\\'s agent for a firm\\n\\nof submarine boat builders who are rivals of dad\\'s. Berg has\\n\\nbeen trying to find out why we abandoned our intention of\\n\\ncompeting for the Government prize.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I hope you didn\\'t tell him.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t intend to,\" replied Tom, smiling grimly, \"but\\n\\nI\\'m afraid I have, however He certainly overheard what I\\n\\nsaid. I spoke too loud. Yes, he must have heard me. That\\'s\\n\\nwhy he hurried off so.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Possibly no harm is done. You didn\\'t give the location of\\n\\nthe sunken ship.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No; but I guess from what I said it will be easy enough\\n\\nto find. Well, if we\\'re going to have a fight for the\\n\\npossession of that sunken gold, I\\'m ready for it. The\\n\\nAdvance is well equipped for a battle. I must tell dad of\\n\\nthis. It\\'s my fault.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And partly mine, for asking you such leading questions in\\n\\na public place,\" declared Mr. Damon. \"Bless my coat-tails,\\n\\nbut I\\'m sorry! Maybe, after all, those men were so\\n\\ninterested in what they themselves were saying that they\\n\\ndidn\\'t understand what you said.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut if there had been any doubts on this score they would\\n\\nhave been dissolved had Tom and his friend been able to see\\n\\nthe actions of Mr. Berg and his companion a little later.\\n\\nThe plans of the treasure-hunters had been revealed to their\\n\\nears.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Eight\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother Treasure Expedition\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile Tom and Mr. Damon continued on to Atlantis after the\\n\\noil, the young inventor lamenting from time to time that his\\n\\nremarks about the real destination of the Advance had been\\n\\noverheard by Mr. Berg, the latter and his companion were\\n\\nhastening back along the path that ran on one side of the\\n\\nsand dunes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s your hurry?\" asked Mr. Maxwell, who was with the\\n\\nsubmarine agent. \"You turned around as if you were shot when\\n\\nyou saw that man and the lad. There didn\\'t appear to be any\\n\\ncause for such a hurry. From what I could hear they were\\n\\ntalking about a submarine. You\\'re in the same business. You\\n\\nmight be friends.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, we might,\" admitted Mr. Berg with a peculiar smile;\\n\\n\"but, unless I\\'m very much mistaken, we\\'re going to be\\n\\nrivals.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Rivals? What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I can\\'t tell you now. Perhaps I may later. But if you\\n\\ndon\\'t mind, walk a little faster, please. I want to get to a\\n\\nlong-distance telephone.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What for?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I have just overheard something that I wish to\\n\\ncommunicate to my employers, Bentley & Eagert.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Overheard something? I don\\'t see what it could be, unless\\n\\nthat lad--\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'ll learn in good time,\" went on the submarine agent.\\n\\n\"But I must telephone at once.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nA little later the two men had reached a trolley line that\\n\\nran into Atlantis, and they arrived at the city before Mr.\\n\\nDamon and Tom got there, as the latter had to go by a\\n\\ncircuitous route. Mr. Berg lost no time in calling up his\\n\\nfirm by telephone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I have had another talk with Mr. Swift,\" he reported to\\n\\nMr. Bentley, who came to the instrument in Philadelphia.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, what does he say?\" was the impatient question. \"I\\n\\ncan\\'t understand his not wanting to try for the Government\\n\\nprize. It is astonishing. You said you were going to\\n\\ndiscover the reason, Mn Berg, but you haven\\'t done so.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I have.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What is it?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, the reason Mr. Swift and his son don\\'t care to try\\n\\nfor the fifty thousand dollar prize is that they are after\\n\\none of three hundred thousand dollars.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Three hundred thousand dollars!\" cried Mr, Bentley. \"What\\n\\ngovernment is going to offer such a prize as that for\\n\\nsubmarines, when they are getting almost as common as\\n\\nairships? We ought to have a try for that ourselves. What\\n\\ngovernment is it?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No government at all. But I think we ought to have a try\\n\\nfor it, Mr. Bentley.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Explain.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I have just learned, most accidentally, that the\\n\\nSwifts are going after sunken treasure--three hundred\\n\\nthousand dollars in gold bullion.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Sunken treasure? Where?\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know exactly, but off the coast of Uruguay,\" and\\n\\nMr. Berg rapidly related what he had overheard Tom tell Mr.\\n\\nDamon. Mr. Bentley was much excited and impatient for more\\n\\ndetails, but his agent could not give them to him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" concluded the senior member of the firm of\\n\\nsubmarine boat builders, \"if the Swifts are going after\\n\\ntreasure, so can we. Come to Philadelphia at once, Mr. Berg,\\n\\nand we\\'ll talk this matter over. There is no time to lose.\\n\\nWe can afford to forego the Government prize for the chance\\n\\nof getting a much larger one. We have as much right to\\n\\nsearch for the sunken gold as the Swifts have. Come here at\\n\\nonce, and we will make our plans.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"All right,\" agreed the agent with a smile as he hung up\\n\\nthe receiver. \"I guess,\" he murmured to himself, \"that you\\n\\nwon\\'t be so high and mighty with me after this, Tom Swift.\\n\\nWe\\'ll see who has the best boat, after all. We\\'ll have a\\n\\ncontest and a competition, but not for a government prize.\\n\\nIt will be for the sunken gold.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was easy to see that Mr. Berg was much pleased with\\n\\nhimself.\\n\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, Tom and Mr. Damon had reached Atlantis, and had\\n\\npurchased the oil. They started back, but Tom took a street\\n\\nleading toward the center of the place, instead of striking\\n\\nfor the beach path, along which they had come.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Where are you going?\" asked Mr. Damon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I want to see if that Andy Foger has come back here,\"\\n\\nreplied the lad, and he told of having been shut in the tank\\n\\nby the bully.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ve never properly punished him for that trick,\" he went\\n\\non, \"though we did manage to burst his auto tires. I\\'m\\n\\ncurious to know how he knew enough to turn that gear and\\n\\nshut the tank door. He must have been loitering near the\\n\\nshop, seen me go in the submarine alone, watched his chance\\n\\nand sneaked in after me. But I\\'d like to get a complete\\n\\nexplanation, and if I once got hold of Andy I could make him\\n\\ntalk,\" and Tom clenched his fist in a manner that augured no\\n\\ngood for the squint-eyed lad. \"He was stopping at the same\\n\\nhotel with Mr. Berg, and be hurried away after the trick he\\n\\nplayed on me. I next saw him in Shopton, but I thought\\n\\nperhaps he might have come back here. I\\'m going to inquire\\n\\nat the hotel,\" he added.\\n\\n\\n\\nAndy\\'s name was not on the register since his hasty\\n\\nflight, however, and Tom, after inquiring from the clerk and\\n\\nlearning that Mr. Berg was still a guest at the hostelry,\\n\\nrejoined Mr. Damon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my hat!\" exclaimed that eccentric individual as\\n\\nthey started back to the lonely beach where the submarine\\n\\nwas awaiting her advent into the water. \"The more I think\\n\\nof the trip I\\'m going to take, the more I like it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I hope you will,\" remarked Tom. \"It will be a new\\n\\nexperience for all of us. There\\'s only one thing worrying\\n\\nme, and that is about Mr. Berg having overheard what I\\n\\nsaid.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, don\\'t worry about that. Can\\'t we slip away and leave\\n\\nno trace in the water?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I hope so, but I must tell dad and Mr. Sharp about what\\n\\nhappened.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe aged inventor was not a little alarmed at what his son\\n\\nrelated, but he agreed with Mr. Damon, whom he heartily\\n\\nwelcomed, that little was to be apprehended from Berg and\\n\\nhis employers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They know we\\'re after a sunken wreck, but that\\'s all they\\n\\ndo know,\" said Tom\\'s father. \"We are only waiting for the\\n\\narrival of Captain Alden Weston, and then we will go. Even\\n\\nif Bentley & Eagert make a try for the treasure we\\'ll have\\n\\nthe start of them, and this will be a case of first come,\\n\\nfirst served. Don\\'t worry, Tom. I\\'m glad you\\'re going, Mn\\n\\nDamon. Come, I will show you our submarine.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAs father and son, with their guest, were going to the\\n\\nmachine shop, Mr. Sharp met them. He had a letter in his\\n\\nhand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Good news!\" the balloonist cried. \"Captain Weston will be\\n\\nwith us to-morrow. He will arrive at the Beach Hotel in\\n\\nAtlantis, and wants one of us to meet him there. He has\\n\\nconsiderable information about the wreck.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The Beach Hotel,\" murmured Tom. \"That is where Mr. Berg\\n\\nis stopping. I hope he doesn\\'t worm any of our secret from\\n\\nCaptain Weston,\" and it was with a feeling of uneasiness\\n\\nthat the young inventor continued after his father and Mr.\\n\\nDamon to where the submarine was.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Nine\\n\\n\\n\\nCaptain Weston\\'s Advent\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my water ballast, but that certainly is a fine boat!\"\\n\\ncried Mr. Damon, when he had been shown over the new craft.\\n\\n\"I think I shall feel even safer in that than in the Red Cloud.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, don\\'t go back on the airship!\" exclaimed Mn Sharp. \"I\\n\\nwas counting on taking you on another trip.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, maybe after we get back from under the ocean,\"\\n\\nagreed Mr. Damon. \"I particularly like the cabin\\n\\narrangements of the Advance. I think I shall enjoy myself.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe would be hard to please who could not take pleasure\\n\\nfrom a trip in the submarine. The cabin was particularly\\n\\nfine, and the sleeping arrangements were good.\\n\\n\\n\\nMore supplies could be carried than was possible on the\\n\\nairship, and there was more room in which to cook and serve\\n\\nfood. Mr. Damon was fond of good living, and the kitchen\\n\\npleased him as much as anything else.\\n\\n\\n\\nEarly the next morning Tom set out for Atlantis, to meet\\n\\nCaptain Weston at the hotel. The young inventor inquired of\\n\\nthe clerk whether the seafaring man had arrived, and was\\n\\ntold that he had come the previous evening.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Is he in his room?\" asked Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No,\" answered the clerk with a peculiar grin. \"He\\'s an\\n\\nodd character. Wouldn\\'t go to bed last night until we had\\n\\nevery window in his room open, though it was blowing quite\\n\\nhard, and likely to storm. The captain said he was used to\\n\\nplenty of fresh air. Well, I guess he got it, all right.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Where is he now?\" asked the youth, wondering what sort of\\n\\nan individual he was to meet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, he was up before sunrise, so some of the scrubwomen\\n\\ntold me. They met him coming from his room, and he went\\n\\nright down to the beach with a big telescope he always\\n\\ncarries with him. He hasn\\'t come back yet. Probably he\\'s\\n\\ndown on the sand.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hasn\\'t he had breakfast?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No. He left word he didn\\'t want to eat until about four\\n\\nbells, whatever time that is.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s ten o\\'clock,\" replied Tom, who had been studying up\\n\\non sea terms lately. \"Eight bells is eight o\\'clock in the\\n\\nmorning, or four in the afternoon or eight at night,\\n\\naccording to the time of day. Then there\\'s one bell for\\n\\nevery half hour, so four bells this morning would be ten\\n\\no\\'clock in this watch, I suppose.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, that\\'s the way it goes, eh?\" asked the clerk. \"I\\n\\nnever could get it through my head. What is twelve o\\'clock\\n\\nnoon?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s eight bells, too; so is twelve o\\'clock midnight.\\n\\nEight bells is as high as they go on a ship. But I guess\\n\\nI\\'ll go down and see if I can meet the captain. It will soon\\n\\nbe ten o\\'clock, or four bells, and he must be hungry for\\n\\nbreakfast. By the way, is that Mr. Berg still here?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No; he went away early this morning. He and Captain\\n\\nWeston seemed to strike up quite an acquaintance, the night\\n\\nclerk told me. They sat and smoked together until long after\\n\\nmidnight, or eight bells,\" and the clerk smiled as he\\n\\nglanced down at the big diamond ring on his little finger.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They did?\" fairly exploded Tom, for he had visions of\\n\\nwhat the wily Mr. Berg might worm out of the simple captain.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes. Why, isn\\'t the captain a proper man to make friends\\n\\nwith?\" and the clerk looked at Tom curiously.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, of course,\" was the hasty answer. \"I guess I\\'ll\\n\\ngo and see if I can find him--the captain, I mean.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom hardly knew what to think. He wished his father, or\\n\\nMr. Sharp, had thought to warn Captain Weston against\\n\\ntalking of the wreck. It might be too late now.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe young inventor hurried to the beach, which was not far\\n\\nfrom the hotel. He saw a solitary figure pacing up and down,\\n\\nand from the fact that the man stopped, every now and then,\\n\\nand gazed seaward through a large telescope, the lad\\n\\nconcluded it was the captain for whom he was in search. He\\n\\napproached, his footsteps making no sound on the sand. The\\n\\nman was still gazing through the glass.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Captain Weston?\" spoke Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\nWithout a show of haste, though the voice must have\\n\\nstartled him, the captain turned. Slowly he lowered the\\n\\ntelescope, and then he replied softly:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s my name. Who are you, if I may ask?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom was struck, more than by anything else, by the gentle\\n\\nvoice of the seaman. He had prepared himself, from the\\n\\ndescription of Mr. Sharp, to meet a gruff, bewhiskered\\n\\nindividual, with a voice like a crosscut saw, and a rolling\\n\\ngait. Instead he saw a man of medium size, with a smooth\\n\\nface, merry blue eyes, and the softest voice and gentlest\\n\\nmanner imaginable. Tom was very much disappointed. He had\\n\\nlooked for a regular sea-dog, and he met a landsman, as he\\n\\nsaid afterward. But it was not long before our hero changed\\n\\nhis mind regarding Captain Weston.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m Tom Swift,\" the owner of that name said, \"and I have\\n\\nbeen sent to show you the way to where our ship is ready to\\n\\nlaunch.\" The young inventor refrained from mentioning\\n\\nsubmarine, as it was the wish of Mn Sharp to disclose this\\n\\nfeature of the voyage to the sailor himself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ha, I thought as much,\" resumed the captain quietly.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a fine day, if I may be permitted to say so,\" and he\\n\\nseemed to hesitate, as if there was some doubt whether or\\n\\nnot he might make that observation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It certainly is,\" agreed the lad. Then, with a smile he\\n\\nadded: \"It is nearly eight bells.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ha!\" exclaimed the captain, also smiling, but even his\\n\\nmanner of saying \"Ha!\" was less demonstrative than that of\\n\\nmost persons. \"I believe I am getting hungry, if I may be\\n\\nallowed the remark,\" and again he seemed asking Tom\\'s pardon\\n\\nfor mentioning the fact.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Perhaps you will come back to the cabin and have a little\\n\\nbreakfast with me,\" he went on. \"I don\\'t know what sort of a\\n\\ngalley or cook they have aboard the Beach Hotel, but it\\n\\ncan\\'t be much worse than some I\\'ve tackled.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, thank you,\" answered the youth. \"I\\'ve had my\\n\\nbreakfast. But I\\'ll wait for you, and then I\\'d like to get\\n\\nback. Dad and Mr. Sharp are anxious to meet you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And I am anxious to meet them, if you don\\'t mind me\\n\\nmentioning it,\" was the reply, as the captain once more put\\n\\nthe spyglass to his eye and took an observation. \"Not many\\n\\nsails in sight this morning,\" he added. \"But the weather is\\n\\nfine, and we ought to get off in good shape to hunt for the\\n\\ntreasure about which Mr. Sharp wrote me. I believe we are\\n\\ngoing after treasure, he said; \"that is, if you don\\'t mind\\n\\ntalking about it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not in the least,\" replied Tom quickly, thinking this a\\n\\ngood opportunity for broaching a subject that was worrying\\n\\nhim. \"Did you meet a Mr. Berg here last night, Captain\\n\\nWeston?\" he went on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes. Mr. Berg and I had quite a talk. He is a well-\\n\\ninformed man.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Did he mention the sunken treasure?\" asked the lad, eager\\n\\nto find out if his suspicions were true.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, he did, if you\\'ll excuse me putting it so plainly,\"\\n\\nanswered the seaman, as if Tom might be offended at so\\n\\ndirect a reply. But the young inventor was soon to learn\\n\\nthat this was only an odd habit with the seaman.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Did he want to know where the wreck of the Boldero was\\n\\nlocated?\" continued the lad. \"That is, did he try to\\n\\ndiscover if you knew anything about it?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Weston, \"he did. He pumped me, if you are\\n\\nacquainted with that term, and are not offended by it. You\\n\\nsee, when I arrived here I made inquiries as to where your\\n\\nfather\\'s place was located. Mr. Berg overheard me, and\\n\\nintroduced himself as agent for a shipbuilding concern. He\\n\\nwas very friendly, and when he said he knew you and your\\n\\nparent, I thought he was all right.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom\\'s heart sank. His worst fears were to be realized, he\\n\\nthought.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, he and I talked considerable, if I may be permitted\\n\\nto say so,\" went on the captain. \"He seemed to know about\\n\\nthe wreck of the Boldero, and that she had three hundred\\n\\nthousand dollars in gold aboard. The only thing he didn\\'t\\n\\nknow was where the wreck was located. He knew it was off\\n\\nUruguay somewhere, but just where he couldn\\'t say. So he\\n\\nasked me if I knew, since he must have concluded that I was\\n\\ngoing with you on the gold-hunting expedition.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And you do know, don\\'t you?\" asked Tom eagerly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I have it pretty accurately charted out, if you\\n\\nwill allow me that expression,\" was the calm answer. \"I took\\n\\npains to look it up at the request of Mr. Sharp.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And he wanted to worm that information out of you?\"\\n\\ninquired the youth excitedly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, I\\'m afraid he did.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Did you give him the location?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" remarked the captain, as he took another\\n\\nobservation before closing up the telescope, \"you see, while\\n\\nwe were talking, I happened to drop a copy of a map I\\'d\\n\\nmade, showing the location of the wreck. Mr. Berg picked it\\n\\nup to hand to me, and he looked at it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh!\" cried Tom. \"Then he knows just where the treasure\\n\\nis, and he may get to it ahead of us. It\\'s too bad.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes,\" continued the seaman calmly, \"Mr. Berg picked up\\n\\nthat map, and he looked very closely at the latitude and\\n\\nlongitude I had marked as the location of the wreck.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then he won\\'t have any trouble finding it,\" murmured our\\n\\nhero.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Eh? What\\'s that?\" asked the captain, \"if I may be\\n\\npermitted to request you to repeat what you said.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I say he won\\'t have any trouble locating the sunken\\n\\nBoldero,\" repeated Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, but I think he will, if he depends on that map,\" was\\n\\nthe unexpected reply. \"You see,\" explained Mr. Weston, \"I\\'m\\n\\nnot so simple as I look. I sensed what Mr. Berg was after,\\n\\nthe minute he began to talk to me. So I fixed up a little\\n\\ngame on him. The map which I dropped on purpose, not\\n\\naccidentally, where he would see it, did have the location\\n\\nof the wreck marked. Only it didn\\'t happen to be the right\\n\\nlocation. It was about five hundred miles out of the way,\\n\\nand I rather guess if Mr. Berg and his friends go there for\\n\\ntreasure they\\'ll find considerable depth of water and quite\\n\\na lonesome spot. Oh, no, I\\'m not as easy as I look, if you\\n\\ndon\\'t mind me mentioning that fact; and when a scoundrel\\n\\nsets out to get the best of me, I generally try to turn the\\n\\ntables on him. I\\'ve seen such men as Mr. Berg before. I\\'m\\n\\nafraid, I\\'m very much afraid, the sight he had of the fake\\n\\nmap I made won\\'t do him much good. Well, I declare, it\\'s\\n\\npast four bells. Let\\'s go to breakfast, if you don\\'t mind me\\n\\nasking you,\" and with that the captain started off up the\\n\\nbeach, Tom following, his ideas all a whirl at the unlooked-\\n\\nfor outcome of the interview.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Ten\\n\\n\\n\\nTrial of the Submarine\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTom felt such a relief at hearing of Captain Weston\\'s ruse\\n\\nthat his appetite, sharpened by an early breakfast and the\\n\\nsea air, came to him with a rush, and he had a second\\n\\nmorning meal with the odd sea captain, who chuckled heartily\\n\\nwhen he thought of how Mn Berg had been deceived.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes,\" resumed Captain Weston, over his bacon and eggs, \"I\\n\\nsized him up for a slick article as soon as I laid eyes on\\n\\nhim. But he evidently misjudged me, if I may be permitted\\n\\nthat term. Oh, well, we may meet again, after we secure the\\n\\ntreasure, and then I can show him the real map of the\\n\\nlocation of the wreck.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then you have it?\" inquired the lad eagerly.\\n\\n\\n\\nCaptain Weston nodded, before hiding his face behind a\\n\\nlarge cup of coffee; his third, by the way.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Let me see it?\" asked Tom quickly. The captain set down\\n\\nhis cup. He looked carefully about the hotel dining-room.\\n\\nThere were several guests, who, like himself, were having a\\n\\nlate breakfast.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s a good plan,\" the sailor said slowly, \"when you\\'re\\n\\ngoing into unknown waters, and don\\'t want to leave a wake\\n\\nfor the other fellow to follow, to keep your charts locked\\n\\nup. If it\\'s all the same to you,\" he added diffidently, \"I\\'d\\n\\nrather wait until we get to where your father and Mr. Sharp\\n\\nare before displaying the real map. I\\'ve no objection to\\n\\nshowing you the one Mr. Berg saw,\" and again he chuckled.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe young inventor blushed at his indiscretion. He felt\\n\\nthat the news of the search for the treasure had leaked out\\n\\nthrough him, though he was the one to get on the trail of it\\n\\nby seeing the article in the paper. Now he had nearly been\\n\\nguilty of another break. He realized that he must be more\\n\\ncautious. The captain saw his confusion, and said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I know how it is. You\\'re eager to get under way. I don\\'t\\n\\nblame you. I was the same myself when I was your age. But\\n\\nwe\\'ll soon be at your place, and then I\\'ll tell you all I\\n\\nknow. Sufficient now, to say that I believe I have located\\n\\nthe wreck within a few miles. I got on the track of a sailor\\n\\nwho had met one of the shipwrecked crew of the Boldero, and\\n\\nhe gave me valuable information. Now tell me about the\\n\\ncraft we are going in. A good deal depends on that.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom hardly knew what to answer. He recalled what Mr. Sharp\\n\\nhad said about not wanting to tell Captain Weston, until\\n\\nthe last moment, that they were going in a submarine, for\\n\\nfear the old seaman (for he was old in point of service\\n\\nthough not in years) might not care to risk an under-water\\n\\ntrip. Therefore Tom hesitated. Seeing it, Captain Weston\\n\\nremarked quietly:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I mean, what type is your submarine? Does it go by\\n\\ncompressed air, or water power?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"How do you know it\\'s a submarine?\" asked the young\\n\\ninventor quickly, and in some confusion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Easy enough. When Mr. Berg thought he was pumping me, I\\n\\nwas getting a lot of information from him. He told me about\\n\\nthe submarine his firm was building, and, naturally, he\\n\\nmentioned yours. One thing led to another until I got a\\n\\npretty good idea of your craft. What do you call it?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The Advance.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Good name. I like it, if you don\\'t mind speaking of it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We were afraid you wouldn\\'t like it,\" commented Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What, the name?,\\'\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, the idea of going in a submarine.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh,\" and Captain Weston laughed. \"Well, it takes more\\n\\nthan that to frighten me, if you\\'ll excuse the expression.\\n\\nI\\'ve always had a hankering to go under the surface, after\\n\\nso many years spent on top. Once or twice I came near going\\n\\nunder, whether I wanted to or not, in wrecks, but I think I\\n\\nprefer your way. Now, if you\\'re all done, and don\\'t mind me\\n\\nspeaking of it, I think we\\'ll start for your place. We must\\n\\nhustle, for Berg may yet get on our trail, even if he has\\n\\ngot the wrong route,\" and he laughed again.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was no small relief to Mn Swift and Mr. Sharp to learn\\n\\nthat Captain Weston had no objections to a submarine, as\\n\\nthey feared he might have. The captain, in his diffident\\n\\nmanner, made friends at once with the treasure-hunters, and\\n\\nhe and Mr. Damon struck up quite an acquaintance. Tom told\\n\\nof his meeting with the seaman, and the latter related, with\\n\\nmuch gusto, the story of how he had fooled Mr. Berg.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, perhaps you\\'d like to come and take a look at the\\n\\ncraft that is to be our home while we\\'re beneath the water,\"\\n\\nsuggested Mr. Swift and the sailor assenting, the aged\\n\\ninventor, with much pride, assisted by Tom, pointed out on\\n\\nthe Advance the features of interest. Captain Weston gave\\n\\nhearty approval, making one or two minor suggestions, which\\n\\nwere carried out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And so you launch her to-morrow,\" he concluded, when he\\n\\nhad completed the inspection \"Well, I hope it\\'s a success,\\n\\nif I may be permitted to say so.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThere were busy times around the machine shop next day. So\\n\\nmuch secrecy had been maintained that none of the residents,\\n\\nor visitors to the coast resort, were aware that in their\\n\\nmidst was such a wonderful craft as the submarine. The last\\n\\ntouches were put on the under-water ship; the ways, leading\\n\\nfrom the shop to the creek, were well greased, and all was\\n\\nin readiness for the launching. The tide would soon be at\\n\\nflood, and then the boat would slide down the timbers (at\\n\\nleast, that was the hope of all), and would float in the\\n\\nelement meant to receive her. It was decided that no one\\n\\nshould be aboard when the launching took place, as there was\\n\\nan element of risk attached, since it was not known just how\\n\\nbuoyant the craft was. It was expected she would float,\\n\\nuntil the filled tanks took her to the bottom, but there was\\n\\nno telling.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It will be flood tide now in ten minutes,\" remarked\\n\\nCaptain Weston quietly, looking at his watch. Then he took\\n\\nan observation through the telescope. \"No hostile ships\\n\\nhanging in the offing,\" he reported. \"All is favorable, if\\n\\nyou don\\'t mind me saying so,\" and he seemed afraid lest his\\n\\nremark might give offense.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Get ready,\" ordered Mr. Swift. \"Tom, see that the ropes\\n\\nare all clear,\" for it had been decided to ease the Advance\\n\\ndown into the water by means of strong cables and\\n\\nwindlasses, as the creek was so narrow that the submarine,\\n\\nif launched in the usual way, would poke her nose into the\\n\\nopposite mud bank and stick there.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"All clear,\" reported the young inventor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"High tide!\" exclaimed the captain a moment later,\\n\\nsnapping shut his watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Let go!\" ordered Mr. Swift, and the various windlasses\\n\\nmanned by the inventor, Tom and the others began to unwind\\n\\ntheir ropes. Slowly the ship slid along the greased ways.\\n\\nSlowly she approached the water. How anxiously they all\\n\\nwatched her! Nearer and nearer her blunt nose, with the\\n\\nelectric propulsion plate and the auxiliary propeller, came\\n\\nto the creek, the waters of which were quiet now, awaiting\\n\\nthe turn of the tide.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow little waves lapped the steel sides. It was the first\\n\\ncontact of the Advance with her native element.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Pay out the rope faster!\" cried Mr. Swift.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe windlasses were turned more quickly Foot by foot the\\n\\ncraft slid along until, with a final rush, the stern left\\n\\nthe ways and the submarine was afloat. Now would come the\\n\\ntest. Would she ride on an even keel, or sink out of sight,\\n\\nor turn turtle? They all ran to the water\\'s edge, Tom in the\\n\\nlead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hurrah!\" suddenly yelled the lad, trying to stand on his\\n\\nhead. \"She floats! She\\'s a success! Come on! Let\\'s get\\n\\naboard!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFor, true enough, the Advance was riding like a duck on\\n\\nthe water. She had been proportioned just right, and her\\n\\nlines were perfect. She rode as majestically as did any ship\\n\\ndestined to sail on the surface, and not intended to do\\n\\ndouble duty.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Come on, we must moor her to the pier,\" directed Mr.\\n\\nSharp. \"The tide will turn in a few minutes and take her out\\n\\nto sea.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe and Tom entered a small boat, and soon the submarine\\n\\nwas tied to a small dock that had been built for the\\n\\npurpose.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Now to try the engine,\" suggested Mr. Swift, who was\\n\\nalmost trembling with eagerness; for the completion of the\\n\\nship meant much to him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"One moment,\" begged Captain Weston. \"If you don\\'t mind,\\n\\nI\\'ll take an observation,\" he went on, and he swept the\\n\\nhorizon with his telescope. \"All clear,\" he reported. \"I\\n\\nthink we may go aboard and make a trial trip.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nLittle time was lost in entering the cabin and engine-\\n\\nroom, Garret Jackson accompanying the party to aid with the\\n\\nmachinery. It did not take long to start the motors, dynamos\\n\\nand the big gasolene engine that was the vital part of the\\n\\ncraft. A little water was admitted to the tanks for ballast,\\n\\nsince the food and other supplies were not yet on board. The\\n\\nAdvance now floated with the deck aft of the conning tower\\n\\nshowing about two feet above the surface of the creek. Mr.\\n\\nSwift and Tom entered the pilot house.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Start the engines,\" ordered the aged inventor, \"and we\\'ll\\n\\ntry my new system of positive and negative electrical\\n\\npropulsion.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a hum and whir in the body of the ship beneath\\n\\nthe feet of Tom and his father. Captain Weston stood on the\\n\\nlittle deck near the conning tower.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"All ready?\" asked the youth through the\\n\\nspeaking tube to Mr. Sharp and Mr. Jackson in\\n\\nthe engine-room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"All ready,\" came the answer.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom threw over the connecting lever, while his father\\n\\ngrasped the steering wheel. The Advance shot forward, moving\\n\\nswiftly along, about half submerged.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"She goes! She goes!\" cried Tom\\n\\n\\n\\n\"She certainly does, if I may be permitted to say so,\" was\\n\\nthe calm contribution of Captain Weston. \"I congratulate\\n\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFaster and faster went the new craft. Mr. Swift headed her\\n\\ntoward the open sea, but stopped just before passing out of\\n\\nthe creek, as he was not yet ready to venture into deep\\n\\nwater.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I want to test the auxiliary propellers,\" he said. After\\n\\na little longer trial of the electric propulsion plates,\\n\\nwhich were found to work satisfactorily, sending the\\n\\nsubmarine up and down the creek at a fast rate, the screws,\\n\\nsuch as are used on most submarines, were put into gear.\\n\\nThey did well, but were not equal to the plates, nor was so\\n\\nmuch expected of them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I am perfectly satisfied,\" announced Mr. Swift as he once\\n\\nmore headed the boat to sea. \"I think, Captain Weston, you\\n\\nhad better go below now.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why so?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Because I am going to completely submerge the craft. Tom,\\n\\nclose the conning tower door. Perhaps you will come in here\\n\\nwith us, Captain Weston, though it will be rather a tight\\n\\nfit.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thank you, I will. I want to see how it feels to be in a\\n\\npilot house under water.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom closed the water-tight door of the conning tower. Word\\n\\nwas sent through the tube to the engine-room that a more\\n\\nsevere test of the ship was about to be made. The craft was\\n\\nnow outside the line of breakers and in the open sea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Is everything ready, Tom?\" asked his father in a quiet\\n\\nvoice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Everything,\" replied the lad nervously, for the\\n\\nanticipation of being about to sink below the surface was\\n\\ntelling on them all, even on the calm, old sea captain.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then open the tanks and admit the water,\" ordered Mr.\\n\\nSwift.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis son turned a valve and adjusted some levers. There was\\n\\na hissing sound, and the Advance began sinking. She was\\n\\nabout to dive beneath the surface of the ocean, and those\\n\\naboard her were destined to go through a terrible experience\\n\\nbefore she rose again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Eleven\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the Ocean Bed\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLower and lower sank the submarine. There was a swirling\\n\\nand foaming of the water as she went down, caused by the air\\n\\nbubbles which the craft carried with her in her descent.\\n\\nOnly the top of the conning tower was out of water now, the\\n\\nocean having closed over the deck and the rounded back of\\n\\nthe boat. Had any one been watching they would have imagined\\n\\nthat an accident was taking place.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the pilot house, with its thick glass windows, Tom, his\\n\\nfather and Captain Weston looked over the surface of the\\n\\nocean, which every minute was coming nearer and nearer to\\n\\nthem.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We\\'ll be all under in a few seconds,\" spoke Tom in a\\n\\nsolemn voice, as he listened to the water hissing into the\\n\\ntanks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, and then we can see what sort of progress we will\\n\\nmake,\" added Mr. Swift. \"Everything is going fine, though,\"\\n\\nhe went on cheerfully. \"I believe I have a good boat.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There is no doubt of it in my mind,\" remarked Captain\\n\\nWeston, and Tom felt a little disappointed that the sailor\\n\\ndid not shout out some such expression as \"Shiver my\\n\\ntimbers!\" or \"Keel-haul the main braces, there, you lubber!\"\\n\\nBut Captain Weston was not that kind of a sailor, though his\\n\\nusually quiet demeanor could be quickly dropped on\\n\\nnecessity, as Tom learned later.\\n\\n\\n\\nA few minutes more and the waters closed over the top of\\n\\nthe conning tower. The Advance was completely submerged.\\n\\nThrough the thick glass windows of the pilot house the\\n\\noccupants looked out into the greenish water that swirled\\n\\nabout them; but it could not enter. Then, as the boat went\\n\\nlower, the light from above gradually died out, and the\\n\\nsemi-darkness gave place to gloom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Turn on the electrics and the searchlight, Tom,\" directed\\n\\nhis father.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was the click of a switch, and the conning tower was\\n\\nflooded with light. But as this had the effect of\\n\\npreventing the three from peering out into the water, just\\n\\nas one in a lighted room cannot look out into the night, Tom\\n\\nshut them off and switched on the great searchlight. This\\n\\nprojected its powerful beams straight ahead and there, under\\n\\nthe ocean, was a pathway of illumination for the treasure-\\n\\nseekers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Fine!\" cried Captain Weston, with more enthusiasm than he\\n\\nhad yet manifested. \"That\\'s great, if you don\\'t mind me\\n\\nmentioning it. How deep are we?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom glanced at a gage on the side of the pilot tower.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Only about sixty feet,\" he answered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then don\\'t go any deeper!\" cried the captain hastily. \"I\\n\\nknow these waters around here, and that\\'s about all the\\n\\ndepth you\\'ve got. You\\'ll be on the bottom in a minute.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I intend to get on the bottom after a while,\" said Mr.\\n\\nSwift, \"but not here. I want to try for a greater distance\\n\\nunder water before I come to rest on the ocean\\'s bed. But I\\n\\nthink we are deep enough for a test. Tom, close the tank\\n\\nintake pipes and we\\'ll see how the Advance will progress\\n\\nwhen fully submerged.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe hissing stopped, and then, wishing to see how the\\n\\nmotors and other machinery would work, the aged inventor and\\n\\nhis son, accompanied by Captain Weston, descended from the\\n\\nconning tower, by means of an inner stairway, to the\\n\\ninterior of the ship. The submarine could be steered and\\n\\nmanaged from below or above. She was now floating about\\n\\nsixty-five feet below the surface of the bay.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, how do you like it?\" asked Tom of Mr. Damon, as he\\n\\nsaw his friend in an easy chair in the living-room or main\\n\\ncabin of the craft, looking out of one of the plate-glass\\n\\nwindows on the side.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my spectacles, it\\'s the most wonderful thing I ever\\n\\ndreamed of!\" cried the queer character, as he peered at the\\n\\nmass of water before him. \"To think that I\\'m away down under\\n\\nthe surface, and yet as dry as a bone. Bless my necktie, but\\n\\nit\\'s great! What are we going to do now?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Go forward,\" replied the young inventor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Perhaps I had better make an observation,\" suggested\\n\\nCaptain Weston, taking his telescope from under his arm,\\n\\nwhere he had carried it since entering the craft, and\\n\\nopening it. \"We may run afoul of something, if you don\\'t\\n\\nmind me mentioning such a disagreeable subject.\" Then, as he\\n\\nthought of the impossibility of using his glass under water,\\n\\nhe closed it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I shall have little use for this here, I\\'m afraid,\" he\\n\\nremarked with a smile. \"Well, there\\'s some consolation.\\n\\nWe\\'re not likely to meet many ships in this part of the\\n\\nocean. Other vessels are fond enough of remaining on the\\n\\nsurface. I fancy we shall have the depths to ourselves,\\n\\nunless we meet a Government submarine, and they are hardly\\n\\nable to go as deep as we can. No, I guess we won\\'t run into\\n\\nanything and I can put this glass away.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Unless we run into Berg and his crowd,\" suggested Tom in\\n\\na low voice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ha! ha!\" laughed Captain Weston, for he did not want Mr.\\n\\nSwift to worry over the unscrupulous agent. \"No, I don\\'t\\n\\nbelieve we\\'ll meet them, Tom. I guess Berg is trying to work\\n\\nout the longitude and latitude I gave him. I wish I could\\n\\nsee his face when he realizes that he\\'s been deceived by\\n\\nthat fake map.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I hope he doesn\\'t discover it too soon and trail\\n\\nus,\" went on the lad. \"But they\\'re going to start the\\n\\nmachinery now. I suppose you and I had better take charge of\\n\\nthe steering of the craft. Dad will want to be in the\\n\\nengine-room.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"All right,\" replied the captain, and he moved forward\\n\\nwith the lad to a small compartment, shut off from the\\n\\nliving-room, that served as a pilot house when the conning\\n\\ntower was not used. The same levers, wheels and valves were\\n\\nthere as up above, and the submarine could be managed as\\n\\nwell from there as from the other place.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Is everything all right?\" asked Mn Swift as he went into\\n\\nthe engine-room, where Garret Jackson and Mr. Sharp were\\n\\nbusy with oil cans.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Everything,\" replied the balloonist. \"Are you going to\\n\\nstart now?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, we\\'re deep enough for a speed trial. We\\'ll go out to\\n\\nsea, however, and try for a lower depth record, as soon as\\n\\nthere\\'s enough water. Start the engine.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nA moment later the powerful electric currents were flowing\\n\\ninto the forward and aft plates, and the Advance began to\\n\\ngather way, forging through the water.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Straight ahead, out to sea, Tom,\" called his father to\\n\\nhim.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" responded the youth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ha! Quite seaman-like, if you don\\'t mind a reference to\\n\\nit,\" commented Captain Weston with a smile. \"Mind your helm,\\n\\nboy, for you don\\'t want to poke her nose into a mud bank, or\\n\\nrun up on a shoal.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Suppose you steer?\" suggested the lad. \"I\\'d rather take\\n\\nlessons for a while.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"All right. Perhaps it will be safer. I know these waters\\n\\nfrom the top, though I can\\'t say as much for the bottom.\\n\\nHowever, I know where the shoals are.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe powerful searchlight was turned, so as to send its\\n\\nbeams along the path which the submarine was to follow, and\\n\\nthen, as she gathered speed, she shot ahead, gliding through\\n\\nthe waters like a fish.\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Damon divided his time between the forward pilot-room,\\n\\nthe living-apartment, and the place where Mr. Swift, Garret\\n\\nJackson and Mr. Sharp were working over the engines. Every\\n\\nfew minutes he would bless some part of himself, his\\n\\nclothing, or the ship. Finally the old man settled down to\\n\\nlook through the plate-glass windows in the main apartment.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn and on went the submarine. She behaved perfectly, and\\n\\nwas under excellent control. Some times Tom, at the request\\n\\nof his father, would send her toward the surface by means of\\n\\nthe deflecting rudder. Then she would dive to the bottom\\n\\nagain. Once, as a test, she was sent obliquely to the\\n\\nsurface, her tower just emerging, and then she darted\\n\\ndownward again, like a porpoise that had come up to roll\\n\\nover, and suddenly concluded to seek the depths. In fact,\\n\\nhad any one seen the maneuver they would have imagined the\\n\\ncraft was a big fish disporting itself.\\n\\n\\n\\nCaptain Weston remained at Tom\\'s side, giving him\\n\\ninstructions, and watching the compass in order to direct\\n\\nthe steering so as to avoid collisions. For an hour or more\\n\\nthe craft was sent almost straight ahead at medium speed.\\n\\nThen Mr. Swift, joining his son and the captain, remarked:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"How about depth of water here, Captain Weston?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'ve got more than a mile.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Good! Then I\\'m going down to the bottom of the sea! Tom,\\n\\nfill the tanks still more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" answered the lad gaily. \"Now for a new\\n\\nexperience!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And use the deflecting rudder, also,\" advised his father.\\n\\n\"That will hasten matters.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFive minutes later there was a slight jar noticeable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my soul! What\\'s that?\" cried Mr. Damon. \"Have we\\n\\nhit something?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes,\" answered Tom with a smile.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What, for gracious sake?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The bottom of the sea. We\\'re on the bed of the ocean.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Twelve\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a Breath of Air\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey could hardly realize it, yet the depth-gage told the\\n\\nstory. It registered a distance below the surface of the\\n\\nocean of five thousand seven hundred feet--a little over a\\n\\nmile. The Advance had actually come to rest on the bottom of\\n\\nthe Atlantic.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hurrah!\" cried Tom. \"Let\\'s get on the diving suits, dad,\\n\\nand walk about on land under water for a change.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No,\" said Mr. Swift soberly. \"We will hardly have time\\n\\nfor that now. Besides, the suits are not yet fitted with the\\n\\nautomatic air-tanks, and we can\\'t use them. There are still\\n\\nsome things to do before we start on our treasure cruise.\\n\\nBut I want to see how the plates are standing this\\n\\npressure.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Advance was made with a triple hull, the spaces\\n\\nbetween the layers of plates being filled with a secret\\n\\nmaterial, capable of withstanding enormous pressure, as were\\n\\nalso the plates themselves. Mr. Swift, aided by Mr. Jackson\\n\\nand Captain Weston, made a thorough examination, and found\\n\\nthat not a drop of water had leaked in, nor was there the\\n\\nleast sign that any of the plates had given way under the\\n\\nterrific strain.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"She\\'s as tight as a drum, if you will allow me to make\\n\\nthat comparison,\" remarked Captain Weston modestly. \"I\\n\\ncouldn\\'t ask for a dryer ship.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, let\\'s take a look around by means the searchlight\\n\\nand the observation windows, and then we\\'ll go back,\"\\n\\nsuggested Mr. Swift. \"It will take about two days to get the\\n\\nstores and provisions aboard and rig up the diving suits;\\n\\nthen we will start for the sunken treasure.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere were several powerful searchlights on the Advance,\\n\\nso arranged that the bow, stern or either side could be\\n\\nilluminated independently. There were also observation\\n\\nwindows near each light.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn turn the powerful rays were cast first at the bow and\\n\\nthen aft. In the gleams could be seen the sandy bed of the\\n\\nocean, covered with shells of various kinds. Great crabs\\n\\nwalked around on their long, jointed legs, and Tom saw some\\n\\nlobsters that would have brought joy to the heart of a\\n\\nfisherman.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Look at the big fish!\" cried Mr. Damon suddenly, and he\\n\\npointed to some dark, shadowy forms that swam up to the\\n\\nglass windows, evidently puzzled by the light.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Porpoises,\" declared Captain Weston briefly. a whole\\n\\nschool of them.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fish seemed suddenly to multiply, and soon those in\\n\\nthe submarine felt curious tremors running through the whole\\n\\ncraft.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The fish are rubbing up against it,\" cried Tom. \"They\\n\\nmust think we came down here to allow them to scratch their\\n\\nbacks on the steel plates.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFor some time they remained on the bottom, watching the\\n\\nwonderful sight of the fishes that swam all about them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I think we may as well rise,\" announced Mr. Swift,\\n\\nafter they had been on the bottom about an hour, moving here\\n\\nand there. \"We didn\\'t bring any provisions, and I\\'m getting\\n\\nhungry, though I don\\'t know how the others of you feel about\\n\\nit.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my dinner-plate, I could eat, too!\" cried Mr.\\n\\nDamon. \"Go up, by all means. We\\'ll get enough of under-water\\n\\ntravel once we start for the treasure.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Send her up, Tom,\" called his father. \"I Want to make a\\n\\nfew notes on some needed changes and improvements.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom entered the lower pilot house, and turned the valve\\n\\nthat opened the tanks. He also pulled the lever that started\\n\\nthe pumps, so that the water ballast would be more quickly\\n\\nemptied, as that would render the submarine buoyant, and she\\n\\nwould quickly shoot to the surface. To the surprise of the\\n\\nlad, however, there followed no outrushing of the water. The\\n\\nAdvance remained stationary on the ocean bed. Mr. Swift\\n\\nlooked up from his notes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t you hear me ask you to send her up, Tom?\" he\\n\\ninquired mildly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I did, dad, but something seems to be the matter,\" was\\n\\nthe reply.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Matter? What do you mean?\" and the aged inventor hastened\\n\\nto where his son and Captain Weston were at the wheels,\\n\\nvalves and levers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why, the tanks won\\'t empty, and the pumps don\\'t seem to\\n\\nwork.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Let me try,\" suggested Mr. Swift, and he pulled the\\n\\nvarious handles. There was no corresponding action of the\\n\\nmachinery.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s odd,\" he remarked in a curious voice \"Perhaps\\n\\nsomething has gone wrong with the connections. Go look in\\n\\nthe engine-room, and ask Mr. Sharp if everything is all\\n\\nright there.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom made a quick trip, returning to report that the\\n\\ndynamos, motors and gas engine were running perfectly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Try to work the tank levers and pumps from the conning\\n\\ntower,\" suggested Captain Weston. \"Sometimes I\\'ve known the\\n\\nsteam steering gear to play tricks like that.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom hurried up the circular stairway into the tower. He\\n\\npulled the levers and shifted the valves and wheels there.\\n\\nBut there was no emptying of the water tanks. The weight and\\n\\npressure of water in them still held the submarine on the\\n\\nbottom of the sea, more than a mile from the surface. The\\n\\npumps in the engine-room were working at top speed, but\\n\\nthere was evidently something wrong in the connections.\\n\\nMr. Swift quickly came to this conclusion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We must repair it at once,\" he said. \"Tom, come to the\\n\\nengine-room. You and I, with Mr. Jackson and Mr. Sharp, will\\n\\nsoon have it in shape again.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Is there any danger?\" asked Mr. Damon in a perturbed\\n\\nvoice. \"Bless my soul, it\\'s unlucky to have an accident on\\n\\nour trial trip.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, we must expect accidents,\" declared Mr. Swift with a\\n\\nsmile. \"This is nothing.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it proved to be more difficult than he had imagined\\n\\nto re-establish the connection between the pumps and the\\n\\ntanks. The valves, too, had clogged or jammed, and as the\\n\\npressure outside the ship was so great, the water would not\\n\\nrun out of itself. It must be forced.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor an hour or more the inventor, his son and the others,\\n\\nworked away. They could accomplish nothing. Tom looked\\n\\nanxiously at his parent when the latter paused in his\\n\\nefforts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Don\\'t worry,\" advised the aged inventor. \"It\\'s got to\\n\\ncome right sooner or later.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nJust then Mr. Damon, who had been wandering about the\\n\\nship, entered the engine-room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Do you know,\" he said, \"you ought to open a window, or\\n\\nsomething.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why, what\\'s the matter?\" asked Tom quickly, looking to\\n\\nsee if the odd man was joking.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, of course I don\\'t exactly mean a window,\" explained\\n\\nMr. Damon, \"but we need fresh air.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Fresh air!\" There was a startled note in Mr. Swift\\'s\\n\\nvoice as he repeated the words.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, I can hardly breathe in the living-room, and it\\'s\\n\\nnot much better here.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why, there ought to be plenty of fresh air,\" went on the\\n\\ninventor. \"It is renewed automatically.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom jumped up and looked at an indicator. He uttered a\\n\\nstartled cry.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The air hasn\\'t been changed in the last hour!\" he\\n\\nexclaimed. \"It is bad. There\\'s not enough oxygen in it. I\\n\\nnotice it, now that I\\'ve stopped working. The gage indicates\\n\\nit, too. The automatic air-changer must have stopped\\n\\nworking. I\\'ll fix it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe hurried to the machine which was depended on to supply\\n\\nfresh air to the submarine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why, the air tanks are empty!\" the young inventor cried.\\n\\n\"We haven\\'t any more air except what is in the ship now!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And we\\'re rapidly breathing that up,\" added Captain\\n\\nWeston solemnly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Can\\'t you make more?\" cried Mr. Damon. \"I thought you\\n\\nsaid you could make oxygen aboard the ship.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We can,\" answered Mr. Swift, \"but I did not bring along a\\n\\nsupply of the necessary chemicals. I did not think we would\\n\\nbe submerged long enough for that. But there should have\\n\\nbeen enough in the reserve tank to last several days. How\\n\\nabout it, Tom?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s all leaked out, or else it wasn\\'t filled,\" was the\\n\\ndespairing answer. \"All the air we have is what\\'s in the\\n\\nship, and we can\\'t make more.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe treasure-seekers looked at each other. It was an awful\\n\\nsituation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then the only thing to do is to fix the machinery and\\n\\nrise to the surface,\" said Mr. Sharp simply. \"We can have\\n\\nall the air we want, then.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, but the machinery doesn\\'t seem possible of being\\n\\nfixed,\" spoke Tom in a low voice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We must do it!\" cried his father.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey set to work again with fierce energy, laboring for\\n\\ntheir very lives. They all knew that they could not long\\n\\nremain in the ship without oxygen. Nor could they desert it\\n\\nto go to the surface, for the moment they left the\\n\\nprotection of the thick steel sides the terrible pressure of\\n\\nthe water would kill them. Nor were the diving suits\\n\\navailable. They must stay in the craft and die a miserable\\n\\ndeath-unless the machinery could be repaired and the Advance\\n\\nsent to the surface. The emergency expanding lifting tank\\n\\nwas not yet in working order.\\n\\n\\n\\nMore frantically they toiled, trying every device that was\\n\\nsuggested to the mechanical minds of Tom, his father, Mr.\\n\\nSharp or Mr. Jackson, to make the pumps work. But something\\n\\nwas wrong. More and more foul grew the air. They were\\n\\nfairly gasping now. It was  difficult to breathe, to say\\n\\nnothing of working, in that atmosphere. The thought of their\\n\\nterrible position was in the minds of all.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, for one breath of fresh air!\" cried Mr. Damon, who\\n\\nseemed to suffer more than any of the others. Grim death was\\n\\nhovering around them, imprisoned as they were on the ocean\\'s\\n\\nbed, over a mile from the surface.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Thirteen\\n\\n\\n\\nOff for the Treasure\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly Tom, after a moment\\'s pause, seized a wrench and\\n\\nbegan loosening some nuts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What are you doing?\" asked his father faintly, for he was\\n\\nbeing weakened by the vitiated atmosphere.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m going to take this valve apart,\" replied his son. \"We\\n\\nhaven\\'t looked there for the trouble. Maybe it\\'s out of\\n\\norder.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe attacked the valve with energy, but his hands soon\\n\\nlagged. The lack of oxygen was telling on him. He could no\\n\\nlonger work quickly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll help,\" murmured Mr. Sharp thickly. He took a wrench,\\n\\nbut no sooner had he loosened one nut than he toppled over.\\n\\n\"I\\'m all in,\" he murmured feebly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Is he dead?\" cried Mr. Damon, himself gasping.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, only fainted. But he soon will be dead, and so will\\n\\nall of us, if we don\\'t get fresh air,\" remarked Captain\\n\\nWeston. \"Lie down on the floor, every one. There is a little\\n\\nfairly good air there. It\\'s heavier than the air we\\'ve\\n\\nbreathed, and we can exist on it for a little longer. Poor\\n\\nSharp was so used to breathing the rarified air of high\\n\\naltitudes that he can\\'t stand this heavy atmosphere.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Damon was gasping worse than ever, and so was Mr.\\n\\nSwift. The balloonist lay an inert heap on the floor, with\\n\\nCaptain Weston trying to force a few drops of stimulant down\\n\\nhis throat\\n\\n\\n\\nWith a fierce determination in his heart, but with fingers\\n\\nthat almost refused to do his bidding, Tom once more sought\\n\\nto open the big valve. He felt sure the trouble was located\\n\\nthere, as they had tried to locate it in every other place\\n\\nwithout avail.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll help,\" said Mr. Jackson in a whisper. He, too, was\\n\\nhardly able to move.\\n\\n\\n\\nMore and more devoid of oxygen grew the air. It gave Tom a\\n\\nsense as if his head was filled, and ready to burst with\\n\\nevery breath he drew. Still he struggled to loosen the nuts.\\n\\nThere were but four more now, and he took off three while\\n\\nMr. Jackson removed one. The young inventor lifted off the\\n\\nvalve cover, though it felt like a ton weight to him. He\\n\\ngave a glance inside.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Here\\'s the trouble!\" he murmured. \"The valve\\'s clogged.\\n\\nNo wonder it wouldn\\'t work. The pumps couldn\\'t force the\\n\\nwater out.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was the work of only a minute to adjust the valve. Then\\n\\nTom and the engineer managed to get the cover back on.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow they inserted the bolts and screwed the nuts in place\\n\\nthey never could remember clearly afterward, but they\\n\\nmanaged it somehow, with shaking, trembling hands and eyes\\n\\nthat grew more and more dim.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Now start the pumps!\" cried Tom faintly. \"The tanks will\\n\\nbe emptied, and we can get to the surface.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Sharp was still unconscious, nor was Mr. Swift able to\\n\\nhelp. He lay with his eyes closed. Garret Jackson, however,\\n\\nmanaged to crawl to the engine-room, and soon the clank of\\n\\nmachinery told Tom that the pumps were in motion. The lad\\n\\nstaggered to the pilot house and threw the levers over. An\\n\\ninstant later there was the hissing of water as it rushed\\n\\nfrom the ballast tanks. The submarine shivered, as though\\n\\ndisliking to leave the bottom of the sea, and then slowly\\n\\nrose. As the pumps worked more rapidly, and the sea was sent\\n\\nfrom the tank in great volumes, the boat fairly shot to the\\n\\nsurface. Tom was ready to open the conning tower and let in\\n\\nfresh air as soon as the top was above the surface.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith a bound the Advance reached the top. Tom frantically\\n\\nworked the worm gear that opened the tower. In rushed the\\n\\nfresh, life-giving air, and the treasure-hunters filled\\n\\ntheir lungs with it.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd it was only just in time, for Mr. Sharp was almost\\n\\ngone. He quickly revived, as did the others, when they could\\n\\nbreathe as much as they wished of the glorious oxygen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That was a close call,\" commented Mr. Swift. \"We\\'ll not\\n\\ngo below again until I have provided for all emergencies. I\\n\\nshould have seen to the air tanks and the expanding one\\n\\nbefore going below. We\\'ll sail home on the surface now.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe submarine was put about and headed for her dock. On\\n\\nthe way she passed a small steamer, and the passengers\\n\\nlooked down in wonder at the strange craft.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the Advance reached the secluded creek where she had\\n\\nbeen launched, her passengers had fully recovered from their\\n\\nterrible experience, though the nerves of Mr. Swift and Mr.\\n\\nDamon were not at ease for some days thereafter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I should never have made a submerged test without making\\n\\nsure that we had a reserve supply of air,\" remarked the aged\\n\\ninventor. \"I will not be caught that way again. But I can\\'t\\n\\nunderstand how the pump valve got out of order.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Maybe some one tampered with it,\" suggested Mr. Damon.\\n\\n\"Could Andy Foger, any of the Happy Harry gang, or the rival\\n\\ngold-seekers have done it?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I hardly think so,\" answered Tom. \"The place has been too\\n\\ncarefully guarded since Berg and Andy once sneaked in. I\\n\\nthink it was just an accident, but I have thought of a plan\\n\\nwhereby such accidents can be avoided in the future. It\\n\\nneeds a simple device.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Better patent it,\" suggested Mr. Sharp with a smile.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Maybe I will,\" replied the young inventor. \"But not now.\\n\\nWe haven\\'t time, if we intend to get fitted out for our\\n\\ntrip.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No; I should say the sooner we started the better,\"\\n\\nremarked Captain Weston. \"That is, if you don\\'t mind me\\n\\nspeaking about it,\" he added gently, and the others smiled,\\n\\nfor his diffident comments were only a matter of habit\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first act of the adventurers, after tying the\\n\\nsubmarine at the dock, was to proceed with the loading of\\n\\nthe food and supplies. Tom and Mr. Damon looked to this,\\n\\nwhile Mr. Swift and Mr. Sharp made some necessary changes to\\n\\nthe machinery. The next day the young inventor attached his\\n\\ndevice to the pump valve, and the loading of the craft was\\n\\ncontinued.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll was in readiness for the gold-seeking expedition a\\n\\nweek later. Captain Weston had carefully charted the route\\n\\nthey were to follow, and it was decided to move along on the\\n\\nsurface for the first day, so as to get well out to sea\\n\\nbefore submerging the craft. Then it would sink below the\\n\\nsurface, and run along under the water until the wreck was\\n\\nreached, rising at times, as needed, to renew the air\\n\\nsupply.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith sufficient stores and provisions aboard to last\\n\\nseveral months, if necessary, though they did not expect to\\n\\nbe gone more than sixty days at most, the adventurers arose\\n\\nearly one morning and went down to the dock. Mr. Jackson was\\n\\nnot to accompany them. He did not care about a submarine\\n\\ntrip, he said, and Mr. Swift desired him to remain at the\\n\\nseaside cottage and guard the shops, which contained much\\n\\nvaluable machinery. The airship was also left there.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, are we all ready?\" asked Mr. Swift of the little\\n\\nparty of gold-seekers, as they were about to enter the\\n\\nconning tower hatchway of the submarine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"All ready, dad,\" responded his son.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then let\\'s get aboard,\" proposed Captain Weston. \"But\\n\\nfirst let me take an observation.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe swept the horizon with his telescope, and Tom noticed\\n\\nthat the sailor kept it fixed on one particular spot for\\n\\nsome time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Did you see anything?\" asked the lad.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, there is a boat lying off there,\" was the answer.\\n\\n\"And some one is observing us through a glass. But I don\\'t\\n\\nbelieve it matters. Probably they\\'re only trying to see what\\n\\nsort of an odd fish we are.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"All aboard, then,\" ordered Mr. Swift, and they went into\\n\\nthe submarine. Tom and his father, with Captain Weston,\\n\\nremained in the conning tower. The signal was given, the\\n\\nelectricity flowed into the forward and aft plates, and the\\n\\nAdvance shot ahead on the surface.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sailor raised his telescope once more and peered\\n\\nthrough a window in the tower. He uttered an exclamation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" asked Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That other ship--a small steamer--is weighing anchor and\\n\\nseems to be heading this way,\" was the reply.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Maybe it\\'s some one hired by Berg to follow us and trace\\n\\nour movements,\" suggested Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If it is we\\'ll fool them,\" added his father. \"Just keep\\n\\nan eye on them, captain, and I think we can show them a\\n\\ntrick or two in a few minutes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFaster shot the Advance through the water. She had started\\n\\non her way to get the gold from the sunken wreck, but\\n\\nalready enemies were on the trail of the adventurers, for\\n\\nthe ship the sailor had noticed was steaming after them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Fourteen\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the Diving Suits\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was no doubt that the steamer was coming after the\\n\\nsubmarine. Several observations Captain Weston made\\n\\nconfirmed this, and he reported the fact to Mr. Swift.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, we\\'ll change our plans, then,\" said the inventor.\\n\\n\"Instead of sailing on the surface we\\'ll go below. But first\\n\\nlet them get near so they may have the benefit of seeing\\n\\nwhat we do. Tom, go below, please, and tell Mr. Sharp to get\\n\\nevery thing in readiness for a quick descent. We\\'ll slow up\\n\\na bit now, and let them get nearer to us.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe speed of the submarine was reduced, and in a short\\n\\ntime the strange steamer had overhauled her, coming to\\n\\nwithin hailing distance.\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Swift signaled for the machinery to stop and the\\n\\nsubmarine came to a halt on the surface, bobbing about like\\n\\na half-submerged bottle. The inventor opened a bull\\'s-eye in\\n\\nthe tower, and called to a man on the bridge of the steamer:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What are you following us for?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Following you?\" repeated the man, for the strange vessel\\n\\nhad also come to a stop. \"We\\'re not following you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It looks like it,\" replied Mr. Swift. \"You\\'d better give\\n\\nit up.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I guess the waters are free,\" was the quick retort.\\n\\n\"We\\'ll follow you if we like.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Will you? Then come on!\" cried the inventor as he quickly\\n\\nclosed the heavy glass window and pulled a lever. An instant\\n\\nlater the submarine began to sink, and Mr. Swift could not\\n\\nhelp laughing as, just before the tower went under water, he\\n\\nhad a glimpse of the astonished face of the man on the\\n\\nbridge. The latter had evidently not expected such a move as\\n\\nthat.\\n\\n\\n\\nLower and lower in the water went the craft, until it was\\n\\nabout two hundred feet below the surface. Then Mr. Swift\\n\\nleft the conning tower, descended to the main part of the\\n\\nship, and asked Tom and Captain Weston to take charge of the\\n\\npilot house.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Send her ahead, Tom,\" his father said. \"That fellow up\\n\\nabove is rubbing his eyes yet, wondering where we are, I\\n\\nsuppose.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nForward shot the Advance under water, the powerful\\n\\nelectrical plates pulling and pushing her on the way to\\n\\nsecure the sunken gold.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll that morning a fairly moderate rate of speed was\\n\\nmaintained, as it was thought best not to run the new\\n\\nmachinery too fast.\\n\\n\\n\\nDinner was eaten about a quarter of a mile below the\\n\\nsurface, but no one inside the submarine would ever have\\n\\nknown it. Electric lights made the place as brilliant as\\n\\ncould be desired, and the food, which Tom and Mr. Damon\\n\\nprepared, was equal to any that could have been served on\\n\\nland. After the meal they opened the shutters over the\\n\\nwindows in the sides of the craft, and looked at the myriads\\n\\nof fishes swimming past, as the creatures were disclosed in\\n\\nthe glare of the searchlight.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat night they were several hundred miles on their\\n\\njourney, for the craft was speedy, and leaving Tom and\\n\\nCaptain Weston to take the first watch, the others went to\\n\\nbed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my soul, but it does seem odd, though, to go to bed\\n\\nunder water, like a fish,\" remarked Mr. Damon. \"If my wife\\n\\nknew this she would worry to death. She thinks I\\'m off\\n\\nautomobiling. But this isn\\'t half as dangerous as riding in\\n\\na car that\\'s always getting out of order. A submarine for\\n\\nmine, every time.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Wait until we get to the end of this trip,\" advised Tom.\\n\\n\"I guess you\\'ll find almost as many things can happen in a\\n\\nsubmarine as can in an auto,\" and future events were to\\n\\nprove the young inventor to be right.\\n\\n\\n\\nEverything worked well that night, and the ship made good\\n\\nprogress. They rose to the surface the next morning to make\\n\\nsure of their position, and to get fresh air, though they\\n\\ndid not really need the latter, as the reserve supply had\\n\\nnot been drawn on, and was sufficient for several days, now\\n\\nthat the oxygen machine had been put in running order.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the second day the ship was sent to the bottom and\\n\\nhalted there, as Mr. Swift wished to try the new diving\\n\\nsuits. These were made of a new, light, but very strong\\n\\nmetal to withstand the pressure of a great depth.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom, Mr. Sharp and Captain Weston donned the suits, the\\n\\nothers agreeing to wait until they saw how the first trial\\n\\nresulted. Then, too, it was necessary for some one\\n\\nacquainted with the machinery to remain in the ship to\\n\\noperate the door and water chamber through which the divers\\n\\nhad to pass to get out.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe usual plan, with some changes, was followed in letting\\n\\nthe three out of the boat, and on to the bottom of the sea.\\n\\nThey entered a chamber in the side of the submarine, water\\n\\nwas gradually admitted until it equaled in pressure that\\n\\noutside, then an outer door was opened by means of levers,\\n\\nand they could step out\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was a curious sensation to Tom and the others to feel\\n\\nthat they were actually walking along the bed of the ocean.\\n\\nAll around them was the water, and as they turned on the\\n\\nsmall electric lights in their helmets, which lights were\\n\\nfed by storage batteries fastened to the diving suits, they\\n\\nsaw the fish, big and little, swarm up to them, doubtless\\n\\nastonished at the odd creatures which had entered their\\n\\ndomain. On the sand of the bottom, and in and out among the\\n\\nshells and rocks, crawled great spider crabs, big eels and\\n\\nother odd creatures seldom seen on the surface of the water.\\n\\nThe three divers found no difficulty in breathing, as there\\n\\nwere air tanks fastened to their shoulders, and a constant\\n\\nsupply of oxygen was fed through pipes into the helmets. The\\n\\npressure of water did not bother them, and after the first\\n\\nsensation Tom began to enjoy the novelty of it. At first the\\n\\ninability to speak to his companions seemed odd, but he\\n\\nsoon got so he could make signs and motions, and be\\n\\nunderstood.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey walked about for some time, and once the lad came\\n\\nupon a part of a wrecked vessel buried deep in the sand.\\n\\nThere was no telling what ship it was, nor how long it had\\n\\nbeen there, and after silently viewing it. they continued on\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It was great!\" were the first words Tom uttered when he\\n\\nand the others were once more inside the submarine and had\\n\\nremoved the suits. \"If we can only walk around the wreck of\\n\\nthe Boldero that way, we\\'ll have all the gold out of her in\\n\\nno time. There are no life-lines nor air-hose to bother with\\n\\nin these diving suits.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They certainly are a success,\" conceded Mr. Sharp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my topknot!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"I\\'ll try it next\\n\\ntime. I\\'ve always wanted to be a diver, and now I have the\\n\\nchance.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe trip was resumed after the diving chamber had been\\n\\nclosed, and on the third day Captain Weston announced, after\\n\\na look at his chart, that they were nearing the Bahama\\n\\nIslands.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We\\'ll have to be careful not to run into any of the small\\n\\nkeys,\" he said, that being the name for the many little\\n\\npoints of land, hardly large enough to be dignified by the\\n\\nname of island. \"We must keep a constant lookout.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFortune favored them, though once, when Tom was steering,\\n\\nhe narrowly avoided ramming a coral reef with the submarine.\\n\\nThe searchlight showed it to him just in time, and he\\n\\nsheered off with a thumping in his heart.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe course was changed from south to east, so as to get\\n\\nready to swing out of the way of the big shoulder of South\\n\\nAmerica where Brazil takes up so much room, and as they went\\n\\nfarther and farther toward the equator, they noticed that\\n\\nthe waters teemed more and more with fish, some beautiful,\\n\\nsome ugly and fear-inspiring, and some such monsters that it\\n\\nmade one shudder to look at them, even through the thick\\n\\nglass of the bulls-eye windows.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Fifteen\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the Tropical Island\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was on the evening of the fourth day later that Captain\\n\\nWeston, who was steering the craft, suddenly called out:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Land ho!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Where away?\" inquired Tom quickly, for he had read that\\n\\nthis was the proper response to make.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Dead ahead,\" answered the sailor with a smile. \"Shall we\\n\\nmake for it, if I may be allowed the question?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What land is it likely to be?\" Mr. Swift wanted to know.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, some small tropical island,\" replied the seafaring\\n\\nman. \"It isn\\'t down on the charts. Probably it\\'s too small\\n\\nto note. I should say it was a coral island, but we may be\\n\\nable to find a Spring of fresh water there, and some fruit.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then we\\'ll land there,\" decided the inventor. \"We can use\\n\\nsome fresh water, though our distilling and ice apparatus\\n\\ndoes very well.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThey made the island just at dusk, and anchored in a\\n\\nlittle lagoon, where there was a good depth of water.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Now for shore!\" cried Tom, as the submarine swung around\\n\\non the chain. \"It looks like a fine place. I hope there are\\n\\ncocoanuts and oranges here. Shall I get out the electric\\n\\nlaunch, dad?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, you may, and we\\'ll all go ashore. It will do us good\\n\\nto stretch our legs a bit.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCarried in a sort of pocket on the deck of the submarine\\n\\nwas a small electric boat, capable of holding six. It could\\n\\nbe slid from the pocket, or depression, into the water\\n\\nwithout the use of davits, and, with Mr. Sharp to aid him,\\n\\nTom soon had the little craft afloat. The batteries were\\n\\nalready charged, and just as the sun was going down the\\n\\ngold-seekers entered the launch and were soon on shore.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey found a good spring of water close at hand, and Tom\\'s\\n\\nwish regarding the cocoanuts was realized, though there were\\n\\nno oranges. The lad took several of the delicious nuts, and\\n\\nbreaking them open poured the milk into a collapsible cup he\\n\\ncarried, drinking it eagerly. The others followed his\\n\\nexample, and pronounced it the best beverage they had tasted\\n\\nin a long time.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe island was a typical tropical one, not very large, and\\n\\nit did not appear to have been often visited by man. There\\n\\nwere no animals to be seen, but myriads of birds flew here\\n\\nand there amid the trees, the trailing vines and streamers\\n\\nof moss.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Let\\'s spend a day here to-morrow and explore it,\"\\n\\nproposed Tom, and his father nodded an assent. They went\\n\\nback to the submarine as night was beginning to gather, and\\n\\nin the cabin, after supper, talked over the happenings of\\n\\ntheir trip so far.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Do you think we\\'ll have any trouble getting\\n\\nthe gold out of the wrecked vessel?\" asked Tom of Captain\\n\\nWeston, after a pause.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s hard to say. I couldn\\'t learn just how the\\n\\nwreck lays, whether it\\'s on a sandy or a rocky bottom. If\\n\\nthe latter, it won\\'t be so hard, but if the sand has worked\\n\\nin and partly covered it, we\\'ll have some difficulties, if I\\n\\nmay be permitted to say so. However, don\\'t borrow trouble.\\n\\nWe\\'re not there yet, though at the rate we\\'re traveling it\\n\\nwon\\'t be long before we arrive.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nNo watch was set that night, as it was not considered\\n\\nnecessary. Tom was the first to arise in the morning, and he\\n\\nwent out on the deck for a breath of fresh air before\\n\\nbreakfast.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe looked off at the beautiful little island, and as his\\n\\neye took in all of the little lagoon where the submarine was\\n\\nanchored he uttered a startled cry.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd well he might, for, not a hundred yards away, and\\n\\nnearer to the island than was the Advance, floated another\\n\\ncraft--another craft, almost similar in shape and size to\\n\\nthe one built by the Swifts. Tom rubbed his eyes to make\\n\\nsure he was not seeing double. No, there could be no mistake\\n\\nabout it. There was another submarine at the tropical\\n\\nisland.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he looked, some one emerged from the conning tower of\\n\\nthe second craft. The figure seemed strangely familiar. Tom\\n\\nknew in a moment who it was--Addison Berg. The agent saw the\\n\\nlad, too, and taking off his cap and making a mocking bow,\\n\\nhe called out:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Good morning! Have you got the gold yet?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom did not know what to answer. Seeing the other\\n\\nsubmarine, at an island where he had supposed they would not\\n\\nbe disturbed, was disconcerting enough, but to be greeted by\\n\\nBerg was altogether too much, Tom thought. His fears that\\n\\nthe rival boat builders would follow had not been without\\n\\nfoundation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Rather surprised to see us, aren\\'t you?\" went on Mr.\\n\\nBerg, smiling.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Rather,\" admitted Tom, choking over the word.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thought you\\'d be,\" continued Berg. \"We didn\\'t expect to\\n\\nmeet you so soon, but we\\'re glad we did. I don\\'t altogether\\n\\nlike hunting for sunken treasure, with such indefinite\\n\\ndirections as I have.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You--are going to--\" stammered Tom, and then he concluded\\n\\nit would be best not to say anything. But his talk had been\\n\\nheard inside the submarine. His father came to the foot of\\n\\nthe conning tower stairway.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"To whom are you speaking, Tom?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They\\'re here, dad,\" was the youth\\'s answer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Here? Who are here?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Berg and his employers. They\\'ve followed us, dad.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Sixteen\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We\\'ll Race You For It\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Swift hurried up on deck. He was accompanied by\\n\\nCaptain Weston. At the sight of Tom\\'s father, Mr. Berg, who\\n\\nhad been joined by\\' two other men, called out:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You see we also concluded to give up the trial for the\\n\\nGovernment prize, Mr. Swift. We decided there was more money\\n\\nin something else. But we still will have a good chance to\\n\\ntry the merits of our respective boats. We hurried and got\\n\\nours fitted up almost as soon as you did yours, and I think\\n\\nwe have the better craft.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t care to enter into any competition with you,\"\\n\\nsaid Mr. Swift coldly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ah, but I\\'m afraid you\\'ll have to, whether you want to or\\n\\nnot,\" was the insolent reply.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s that?  Do you mean to force this matter upon me?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid I\\'ll have to--my employers and I, that is. You\\n\\nsee, we managed to pick up your trail after you left the\\n\\nJersey coast, having an idea where you were bound, and we\\n\\ndon\\'t intend to lose you now.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Do you mean to follow us?\" asked Captain Weston softly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, you can put it that way if you like,\" answered one\\n\\nof the two men with Mr. Berg.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I forbid it!\" cried Mr. Swift hotly. \"You have no right\\n\\nto sneak after us.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I guess the ocean is free,\" continued the rascally agent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why do you persist in keeping after us?\" inquired the\\n\\naged inventor, thinking it well to ascertain, if possible,\\n\\njust how much the men knew.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Because we\\'re after that treasure as well as you,\" was\\n\\nthe bold reply. \"You have no exclusive right to it. The\\n\\nsunken ship is awaiting the first comer, and whoever gets\\n\\nthere first can take the gold from the wreck. We intend to\\n\\nbe there first, but we\\'ll be fair with you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Fair? What do you mean?\" demanded Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"This: We\\'ll race you for it. The first one to arrive will\\n\\nhave the right to search the wreck for the gold bullion. Is\\n\\nthat fair? Do you agree to it?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We agree to nothing with you,\" interrupted Captain\\n\\nWeston, his usual diffident manner all gone. \"I happen to be\\n\\nin partial command of this craft, and I warn you that if I\\n\\nfind you interfering with us it won\\'t be healthy for you.\\n\\nI\\'m not fond of fighting, but when I begin I don\\'t like to\\n\\nstop,\" and he smiled grimly. \"You\\'d better not follow us.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We\\'ll do as we please,\" shouted the third member of the\\n\\ntrio on the deck of the other boat, which, as Tom could see,\\n\\nwas named the Wonder. \"We intend to get that gold if we\\n\\ncan,\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"All right. I\\'ve warned you,\" went on the sailor, and\\n\\nthen, motioning to Tom and his father to follow, he went\\n\\nbelow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, what\\'s to be done?\" asked Mr. Swift when they were\\n\\nseated in the living-room, and had informed the others of\\n\\nthe presence of the rival submarine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The only thing I see to do is to sneak away unobserved,\\n\\ngo as deep as possible, and make all haste for the wreck,\"\\n\\nadvised the captain. \"They will depend on us, for they have\\n\\nevidently no chart of the wreck, though of course the\\n\\ngeneral location of it may be known to them from reading the\\n\\npapers. I hoped I had thrown them off the track by the false\\n\\nchart I dropped, but it seems they were too smart for us.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Have they a right to follow us?\" asked Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Legally, but not morally. We can\\'t prevent them, I\\'m\\n\\nafraid. The only thing to do is to get there ahead of them.\\n\\nIt will be a race for the sunken treasure, and we must get\\n\\nthere first.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What do you propose doing, captain?\" asked Mr. Damon.\\n\\n\"Bless my shirt-studs, but can\\'t we pull their ship up on\\n\\nthe island and leave it there?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid such high-handed proceedings would hardly\\n\\nanswer,\" replied Mr. Swift. \"No, as Captain Weston says, we\\n\\nmust get there ahead of them. What do you think will be the\\n\\nbest scheme, captain?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, there\\'s no need for us to forego our plan to get\\n\\nfresh water. Suppose we go to the island, that is, some of\\n\\nus, leaving a guard on board here. We\\'ll fill our tanks with\\n\\nfresh water, and at night we\\'ll quietly sink below the\\n\\nsurface and speed away.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThey all voted that an excellent idea, and little time was\\n\\nlost putting it into operation.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll the remainder of that day not a sign of life was\\n\\nvisible about the Wonder. She lay inert on the surface of\\n\\nthe lagoon, not far away from the Advance; but, though no\\n\\none showed himself on the deck, Tom and his friends had no\\n\\ndoubt but that their enemies were closely watching them.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs dusk settled down over The tropical sea, and as the\\n\\nshadows of the trees on the little island lengthened, those\\n\\non board the Advance closed the Conning tower. No lights\\n\\nwere turned on, as they did not want their movements to be\\n\\nseen, but Tom, his father and Mr. Sharp took their positions\\n\\nnear the various machines and apparatus, ready to open the\\n\\ntanks and let the submarine sink to the bottom, as soon as\\n\\nit was possible to do this unobserved.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Luckily there\\'s no moon,\" remarked Captain Weston, as he\\n\\ntook his place beside Tom. \"Once below the surface and we\\n\\ncan defy them to find us. It is odd how they traced us, but\\n\\nI suppose that steamer gave them the clue.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIt rapidly grew dark, as it always does in the tropics,\\n\\nand when a cautious observation from the conning tower did\\n\\nnot disclose the outlines of the other boat, those aboard\\n\\nthe Advance rightly concluded that their rivals were unable\\n\\nto see them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Send her down, Tom,\" called his father, and with a hiss\\n\\nthe water entered the tanks. The submarine quickly sank\\n\\nbelow the surface, aided by the deflecting rudder.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut alas for the hopes of the gold-seekers. No sooner was\\n\\nshe completely submerged, with the engine started so as to\\n\\nsend her out of the lagoon and to the open sea, than the\\n\\nwaters all about were made brilliant by the phosphorescent\\n\\nphenomenon. In southern waters this frequently occurs.\\n\\nMillions of tiny creatures, which, it is said, swarm in the\\n\\nwarm currents, give an appearance of fire to the ocean, and\\n\\nany object moving through it can plainly be seen. It was so\\n\\nwith the Advance. The motion she made in shooting forward,\\n\\nand the undulations caused by her submersion, seemed to\\n\\nstart into activity the dormant phosphorus, and the\\n\\nsubmarine was afloat in a sea of fire.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Quick!\" cried Tom. \"Speed her up! Maybe we can get out of\\n\\nthis patch of water before they see us.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut it was too late. Above them they could hear the\\n\\nelectric siren of the Wonder as it was blown to let them\\n\\nknow that their escape had been noticed. A moment later the\\n\\nwater, which acted as a sort of sounding-board, or\\n\\ntelephone, brought to the ears of Tom Swift and his friends\\n\\nthe noise of the engines of the other craft in operation.\\n\\nShe was coming after them. The race for the possession of\\n\\nthree hundred thousand dollars in gold was already under\\n\\nway. Fate seemed against those on board the Advance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Seventeen\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Race\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDirected by Captain Weston, who glanced at the compass and\\n\\ntold him which way to steer to clear the outer coral reef,\\n\\nTom sent the submarine ahead, signaling for full speed to\\n\\nthe engine-room, where his father and Mr. Sharp were. The\\n\\nbig dynamos purred like great cats, as they sent the\\n\\nelectrical energy into the forward and aft plates, pulling\\n\\nand pushing the Advance forward. On and on she rushed under\\n\\nwater, but ever as she shot ahead the disturbance in the\\n\\nphosphorescent water showed her position plainly. She would\\n\\nbe easy to follow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Can\\'t you get any more speed out of her?\" asked the\\n\\ncaptain of the lad.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes,\" was the quick reply; \"by using the auxiliary screws\\n\\nI think we can. I\\'ll try it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe signaled for the propellers, forward and aft, to be put\\n\\nin operation, and the motor moving the twin screws was\\n\\nturned on. At once there was a perceptible increase to the\\n\\nspeed of the Advance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Are we leaving them behind?\" asked Tom anxiously, as he\\n\\nglanced at the speed gage, and noted that the submarine was\\n\\nnow about five hundred feet below the surface.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hard to tell,\" replied the Captain. \"You\\'d have to take\\n\\nan observation to make sure.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll do it,\" cried the youth. \"You steer, please, and\\n\\nI\\'ll go in the conning tower. I can look forward and aft\\n\\nthere, as well as straight up. Maybe I can see the Wonder.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSpringing up the circular ladder leading into the tower,\\n\\nTom glanced through the windows all about the small pilot\\n\\nhouse. He saw a curious sight. It was as if the submarine\\n\\nwas in a sea of yellowish liquid fire. She was immersed in\\n\\nwater which glowed with the flames that contained no heat.\\n\\nSo light was it, in fact, that there was no need of the\\n\\nincandescents in the tower. The young inventor could have\\n\\nseen to read a paper by the illumination of the phosphorus.\\n\\nBut he had something else to do than observe this\\n\\nphenomenon. He wanted to see if he could catch sight of the\\n\\nrival submarine.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt first he could make out nothing save the swirl and\\n\\nboiling of the sea, caused by the progress of the Advance\\n\\nthrough it. But suddenly, as he looked up, he was aware of\\n\\nsome great, black body a little to the rear and about ten\\n\\nfeet above his craft.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"A shark!\" he exclaimed aloud. \"An immense one, too.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the closer he looked the less it seemed like a shark.\\n\\nThe position of the black object changed. It appeared to\\n\\nsettle down, to be approaching the top of the conning tower.\\n\\nThen, with a suddenness that unnerved him for the time\\n\\nbeing, Tom recognized what it was; it was the underside of a\\n\\nship. He could see the plates riveted together, and then, as\\n\\nbe noted the rounded, cylindrical shape, he knew that it was\\n\\na submarine. It was the Wonder. She was close at hand and\\n\\nwas creeping up on the Advance. But, what was more\\n\\ndangerous, she seemed to be slowly settling in the water.\\n\\nAnother moment and her great screws might crash into the\\n\\nConning tower of the Swifts\\' boat and shave it off. Then the\\n\\nwater would rush in, drowning the treasure-seekers like rats\\n\\nin a trap.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith a quick motion Tom yanked over the lever that allowed\\n\\nmore water to flow into the ballast tanks. The effect was at\\n\\nonce apparent. The Advance shot down toward the bottom of\\n\\nthe sea. At the same time the young inventor signaled to\\n\\nCaptain Weston to notify those in the engine-room to put on\\n\\na little more speed. The Advance fairly leaped ahead, and\\n\\nthe lad, looking up through the bull\\'s-eye in the roof of\\n\\nthe conning tower, had the satisfaction of seeing the rival\\n\\nsubmarine left behind.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe youth hurried down into the interior of the ship to\\n\\ntell what he had seen, and explain the reason for opening\\n\\nthe ballast tanks. He found his father and Mr. Sharp\\n\\nsomewhat excited over the unexpected maneuver of the craft.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So they\\'re still following us,\" murmured Mr. Swift. \"I\\n\\ndon\\'t see why we can\\'t shake them off.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s on account of this luminous water,\" explained\\n\\nCaptain Weston. \"Once we are clear of that it will be easy,\\n\\nI think, to give them the slip. That is, if we can get out\\n\\nof their sight long enough. Of course, if they keep close\\n\\nafter us, they can pick us up with their searchlight, for I\\n\\nsuppose they carry one.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes,\" admitted the aged inventor, \"they have as strong a\\n\\none as we have. In fact, their ship is second only to this\\n\\none in speed and power. I know, for Bentley & Eagert showed\\n\\nme some of the plans before they started it, and asked my\\n\\nopinion. This was before I had the notion of building a\\n\\nsubmarine. Yes, I am afraid we\\'ll have trouble getting away\\n\\nfrom them.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I can\\'t understand this phosphorescent glow keeping up so\\n\\nlong,\" remarked Captain Weston. \"I\\'ve seen it in this\\n\\nlocality several times, but it never covered such an extent\\n\\nof the ocean in my time.  There must be changed conditions\\n\\nhere now.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFor an hour or more the race was kept up, and the two\\n\\nsubmarines forged ahead through the glowing sea. The Wonder\\n\\nremained slightly above and to the rear of the other, the\\n\\nbetter to keep sight of her, and though the Advance was run\\n\\nto her limit of speed, her rival could not be shaken off.\\n\\nClearly the Wonder was a speedy craft.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s too bad that we\\'ve got to fight them, as well as run\\n\\nthe risk of lots of other troubles which are always present\\n\\nwhen sailing under water,\" observed Mn Damon, who wandered\\n\\nabout the submarine like the nervous person he was. \"Bless\\n\\nmy shirt-studs! Can\\'t we blow them up, or cripple them in\\n\\nsome way? They have no right to go after our treasure.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I guess they\\'ve got as much right as we have,\"\\n\\ndeclared Tom. \"It goes to whoever reaches the wreck first.\\n\\nBut what I don\\'t like is their mean, sneaking way of doing\\n\\nit. If they went off on their own hook and looked for it I\\n\\nwouldn\\'t say a word. But they expect us to lead them to the\\n\\nwreck, and then they\\'ll rob us if they can. That\\'s not\\n\\nfair.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Indeed, it isn\\'t,\" agreed Captain Weston, \"if I may be\\n\\nallowed the expression. We ought to find some way of\\n\\nstopping them. But, if I\\'m not mistaken,\" he added quickly,\\n\\nlooking from one of the port bull\\'s-eyes, \"the\\n\\nphosphorescent glow is lessening. I believe we are running\\n\\nbeyond that part of the ocean.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was no doubt of it, the glow was growing less and\\n\\nless, and ten minutes later the Advance was speeding along\\n\\nthrough a sea as black as night. Then, to avoid running into\\n\\nsome wreck, it was necessary to turn on the searchlight.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Are they still after us?\" asked Mr. Swift of his son, as\\n\\nhe emerged from the engine-room, where he had gone to make\\n\\nsome adjustments to the machinery, with the hope of\\n\\nincreasing the speed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll go look,\" volunteered the lad. He climbed up into\\n\\nthe conning tower again, and for a moment, as he gazed back\\n\\ninto the black waters swirling all about, he hoped that they\\n\\nhad lost the Wonder. But a moment later his heart sank as he\\n\\ncaught sight, through the liquid element, of the flickering\\n\\ngleams of another searchlight, the rays undulating through\\n\\nthe sea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Still following,\" murmured the young inventor. \"They\\'re\\n\\nnot going to give up. But we must make \\'em--that\\'s all.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe went down to report what he had seen, and a\\n\\nconsultation was held. Captain Weston carefully studied the\\n\\ncharts of that part of the ocean, and finding that there was\\n\\na great depth of water at hand, proposed a series of\\n\\nevolutions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We can go up and down, shoot first to one side and then\\n\\nto the other,\" he explained. \"We can even drop down to the\\n\\nbottom and rest there for a while. Perhaps, in that way, we\\n\\ncan shake them off.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThey tried it. The Advance was sent up until her conning\\n\\ntower was out of the water, and then she was suddenly forced\\n\\ndown until she was but a few feet from the bottom. She\\n\\ndarted to the left, to the right, and even doubled and went\\n\\nback over the course she had taken. But all to no purpose.\\n\\nThe Wonder proved fully as speedy, and those in her seemed\\n\\nto know just how to handle the submarine, so that every\\n\\nevolution of the Advance was duplicated. Her rival could not\\n\\nbe shaken off.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll night this was kept up, and when morning came, though\\n\\nonly the clocks told it, for eternal night was below the\\n\\nsurface, the rival gold-seekers were still on the trail.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They won\\'t give up,\" declared Mr. Swift hopelessly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, we\\'ve got to race them for it, just as Berg\\n\\nproposed,\" admitted Tom. \"But if they want a straightaway\\n\\nrace we\\'ll give it to \\'em Let\\'s run her to the limit, dad.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s what we\\'ve been doing, Tom.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, not exactly, for we\\'ve been submerged a little too\\n\\nmuch to get the best speed out of our craft. Let\\'s go a\\n\\nlittle nearer the surface, and give them the best race\\n\\nthey\\'ll ever have.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the race began; and such a contest of speed as it\\n\\nwas! With her propellers working to the limit, and every\\n\\nvolt of electricity that was available forced into the\\n\\nforward and aft plates, the Advance surged through the\\n\\nwater, about ten feet below the surface. But the Wonder kept\\n\\nafter her, giving her knot for knot. The course of the\\n\\nleading submarine was easy to trace now, in the morning\\n\\nlight which penetrated ten feet down.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No use,\" remarked Tom again, when, after two hours, the\\n\\nWonder was still close behind them. \"Our only chance is that\\n\\nthey may have a breakdown.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Or run out of air, or something like that,\" added Captain\\n\\nWeston. \"They are crowding us pretty close. I had no idea\\n\\nthey could keep up this speed. If they don\\'t look out,\" he\\n\\nwent on as he looked from one of the aft observation\\n\\nwindows, \"they\\'ll foul us, and--\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHis remarks were interrupted by a jar to the Advance. She\\n\\nseemed to shiver and careened to one side. Then came another\\n\\nbump.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Slow down!\" cried the captain, rushing toward the pilot\\n\\nhouse.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" asked Tom, as he threw the engines\\n\\nand electrical machines out of gear. Have we hit anything?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No. Something has hit us,\" cried the captain. \"Their\\n\\nsubmarine has rammed us.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Rammed us!\" repeated Mr. Swift. \"Tom, run out the\\n\\nelectric cannon! They\\'re trying to sink us! We\\'ll have to\\n\\nfight them. Run out the stern electric gnu and we\\'ll make\\n\\nthem wish they\\'d not followed us.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Eighteen\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Electric Gun\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was much  excitement aboard the Advance. The\\n\\nsubmarine came to a stop in the water, while the treasure-\\n\\nseekers waited anxiously for what was to follow. Would they\\n\\nbe rammed again? This time, stationary as they were, and\\n\\nwith the other boat coming swiftly on, a hole might be stove\\n\\nthrough the Advance, in spite of her powerful sides.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey had not long to wait. Again there came a jar, and\\n\\nonce more the Swifts\\' boat careened. But the blow was a\\n\\nglancing one and, fortunately, did little damage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They certainly must be trying to sink us,\" agreed Captain\\n\\nWeston. \"Come, Tom, we\\'ll take a look from the stern and see\\n\\nwhat they\\'re up to.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And get the stern electric gun ready to fire,\" repeated\\n\\nMr. Swift. \"We must protect ourselves. Mr. Sharp and I will\\n\\ngo to the bow. There is no telling what they may do. They\\'re\\n\\ndesperate, and may ram us from in front\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom and the captain hurried aft. Through the thick plate-\\n\\nglass windows they could see the blunt nose of the Wonder\\n\\nnot far away, the rival submarine having come to a halt.\\n\\nThere she lay, black and silent, like some monster fish\\n\\nwaiting to devour its victim.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There doesn\\'t appear to be much damage done back here,\"\\n\\nobserved Tom. \"No leaks. Guess they didn\\'t puncture us.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Perhaps it was due to an accident that they rammed us,\"\\n\\nsuggested the captain.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, they wouldn\\'t have done it if they hadn\\'t followed\\n\\nus so close,\" was the opinion of the young inventor.\\n\\n\"They\\'re taking too many chances. We\\'ve got to stop \\'em.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What is this electric gun your father speaks of?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why, it\\'s a regular electric cannon. It fires a solid\\n\\nball, weighing about twenty-five pounds, but instead of\\n\\npowder, which would hardly do under water, and instead of\\n\\ncompressed air, which is used in the torpedo tubes of the\\n\\nGovernment submarines, we use a current of electricity. It\\n\\nforces the cannon ball out with great energy.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I wonder what they will do next?\" observed the captain,\\n\\npeering through a bull\\'seye.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We can soon tell,\" replied the youth. \"We\\'ll go ahead,\\n\\nand if they try to follow I\\'m going to fire on them.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Suppose you sink them?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I won\\'t fire to do that; only to disable them. They\\n\\nbrought it on themselves. We can\\'t risk having them damage\\n\\nus. Help me with the cannon, will you please, captain?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe electric cannon was a long, steel tube in the after\\n\\npart of the submarine. It projected a slight distance from\\n\\nthe sides of the ship, and by an ingenious arrangement could\\n\\nhe swung around in a ball and socket joint, thus enabling it\\n\\nto shoot in almost any direction.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was the work of but a few minutes to get it ready and,\\n\\nwith the muzzle pointing toward the Wonder, Tom adjusted the\\n\\nelectric wires and inserted the solid shot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Now we\\'re prepared for them!\" he cried. \"I think a good\\n\\nplan will be to start ahead, and if they try to follow to\\n\\nfire on them. They\\'ve brought it on themselves.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Correct,\" spoke Captain Weston.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom hurried forward to tell his father of this plan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We\\'ll do it!\" cried Mr. Swift. \"Go ahead, Mr. Sharp, and\\n\\nwe\\'ll see if those scoundrels will follow.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe young inventor returned on the run to the electric\\n\\ncannon. There was a whir of machinery, and the Advance\\n\\nmoved forward. She increased her speed, and the two watchers\\n\\nin the stern looked anxiously out of the windows to see what\\n\\ntheir rivals would do.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a moment no movement was noticeable on the part of the\\n\\nWonder. Then, as those aboard her appeared to realize that\\n\\nthe craft on which they depended to pilot them to the sunken\\n\\ntreasure was slipping away, word was given to follow. The\\n\\nship of Berg and his employers shot after the Advance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Here they come!\" cried Captain Weston. \"They\\'re going to\\n\\nram us again!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then I\\'m going to fire on them!\" declared Tom savagely.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn came the Wonder, nearer and nearer. Her speed was\\n\\nrapidly increasing. Suddenly she bumped the Advance, and\\n\\nthen, as if it was an unavoidable accident, the rear\\n\\nsubmarine sheered off to one side.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They\\'re certainly at it again!\" cried Tom, and peering\\n\\nfrom the bull\\'s-eye he saw the Wonder shoot past the mouth\\n\\nof the electric cannon. \"Here it goes!\" he added.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe shoved over the lever, making the proper connection.\\n\\nThere was no corresponding report, for the cannon was\\n\\nnoiseless, but there was a slight jar as the projectile left\\n\\nthe muzzle. The Wonder could be seen to heel over.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You hit her! You hit her!\" cried Captain Weston. \"A good\\n\\nshot!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I was afraid she was past me when I pulled the lever,\"\\n\\nexplained Tom. \"She went like a flash.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, you caught her on the rudder,\" declared the captain.\\n\\n\"I think you\\'ve put her out of business. Yes, they\\'re rising\\n\\nto the surface.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe lad rapidly inserted another ball, and recharged the\\n\\ncannon. Then he peered out into the water, illuminated by\\n\\nthe light of day overhead, as they were not far down. He\\n\\ncould see the Wonder rising to the surface. Clearly\\n\\nsomething had happened.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Maybe they\\'re going to drop down on us from above, and\\n\\ntry to sink us,\" suggested the youth, while he stood ready\\n\\nto fire again. \"If they do--\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHis words were interrupted by a slight jar throughout the\\n\\nsubmarine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What was that?\" cried the captain.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Dad fired the bow gun at them, but I don\\'t believe he hit\\n\\nthem,\" answered the young inventor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I wonder what damage I did? Guess we\\'ll go to the surface\\n\\nto find out.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nClearly the Wonder had given up the fight for the time\\n\\nbeing. In fact, she had no weapon with which to respond to a\\n\\nfusillade from her rival. Tom hastened forward and informed\\n\\nhis father of what had happened.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If her steering gear is out of order, we may have a\\n\\nchance to slip away,\" said Mr. Swift \"We\\'ll go up and see\\n\\nwhat we can learn.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nA few minutes later Tom, his father and Captain Weston\\n\\nstepped from the conning tower, which was out of water, on\\n\\nto the little flat deck a short distance away lay the\\n\\nWonder, and on her deck was Berg and a number of men,\\n\\nevidently members of the crew.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why did you fire on us?\" shouted the agent angrily.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why did you follow us?\" retorted Torn.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, you\\'ve broken our rudder and disabled us,\" went on\\n\\nBerg, not answering the question. \"You\\'ll suffer for this!\\n\\nI\\'ll have you arrested.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You only got what you deserved,\" added Mr. Swift. \"You\\n\\nwere acting illegally, following us, and you tried to sink\\n\\nus by ramming my craft before we retaliated by firing on\\n\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It was an accident, ramming you,\" said Berg. \"We couldn\\'t\\n\\nhelp it. I now demand that you help us make repairs.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, you\\'ve got nerve!\" cried Captain Weston, his eyes\\n\\nflashing. \"I\\'d like to have a personal interview with you\\n\\nfor about ten minutes. Maybe something besides your ship\\n\\nwould need repairs then.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBerg turned away, scowling, but did not reply. He began\\n\\ndirecting the crew what to do about the broken rudder.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Come on,\" proposed Tom in a low voice, for sounds carry\\n\\nvery easily over water. \"Let\\'s go below and skip out while\\n\\nwe have a chance. They can\\'t follow now, and we can get to\\n\\nthe sunken treasure ahead of them.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Good advice,\" commented his father. \"Come, Captain\\n\\nWeston, we\\'ll go below and close the conning tower.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFive minutes later the Advance sank from sight, the last\\n\\nglimpse Tom had of Berg and his men being a sight of them\\n\\nstanding on the deck of their floating boat, gazing in the\\n\\ndirection of their successful rival. The Wonder was left\\n\\nbehind, while Tom and his friends were soon once more\\n\\nspeeding toward the treasure wreck.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Nineteen\\n\\n\\n\\nCaptured\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Down deep,\" advised Captain Weston, as he stood beside\\n\\nTom and Mr. Swift in the pilot house. \"As far as you can\\n\\nmanage her, and then forward. We\\'ll take no more chances\\n\\nwith these fellows.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The only trouble is,\" replied the young inventor, \"that\\n\\nthe deeper we go the slower we have to travel. The water is\\n\\nso dense that it holds us back.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, there is no special need of hurrying now,\" went on\\n\\nthe sailor. \"No one is following you, and two or three days\\n\\ndifference in reaching the wreck will not amount to\\n\\nanything.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Unless they repair their rudder, and take after us\\n\\nagain,\" suggested Mr. Swift.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They\\'re not very likely to do that,\" was the captain\\'s\\n\\nopinion. \"It was more by luck than good management that they\\n\\npicked us up before. Now, having to delay, as they will, to\\n\\nrepair their steering gear, while we can go as deep as we\\n\\nplease and speed ahead, it is practically impossible for\\n\\nthem to catch up to us. No, I think we have nothing to fear\\n\\nfrom them.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut though danger from Berg and his crowd was somewhat\\n\\nremote, perils of another sort were hovering around the\\n\\ntreasure-seekers, and they were soon to experience them.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was much different from sailing along in the airship,\\n\\nTom thought, for there was no blue sky and fleecy clouds to\\n\\nsee, and they could not look down and observe, far below\\n\\nthem, cities and villages. Nor could they breathe the\\n\\nbracing atmosphere of the upper regions.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut if there was lack of the rarefied air of the clouds,\\n\\nthere was no lack of fresh atmosphere. The big tanks carried\\n\\na large supply, and whenever more was needed the oxygen\\n\\nmachine would supply it.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs there was no need, however, of remaining under water\\n\\nfor any great stretch of time, it was their practice to rise\\n\\nevery day and renew the air supply, also to float along on\\n\\nthe surface for a while, or speed along, with only the\\n\\nconning tower out, in order to afford a view, and to enable\\n\\nCaptain Weston to take observations. But care was always\\n\\nexercised to make sure no ships were in sight when emerging\\n\\non the surface, for the gold-seekers did not want to be\\n\\nhailed and questioned by inquisitive persons.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was about four days after the disabling of the rival\\n\\nsubmarine, and the Advance was speeding along about a mile\\n\\nand a half under water. Tom was in the pilot house with\\n\\nCaptain Weston, Mr. Damon was at his favorite pastime of\\n\\nlooking out of the glass side windows into the ocean and its\\n\\nwonders, and Mr. Swift and the balloonists were, as usual,\\n\\nin the engine-room.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"How near do you calculate we are to the sunken wreck?\"\\n\\nasked Tom of his companion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, at the calculation we made yesterday, we are within\\n\\nabout a thousand miles of it now. We ought to reach it in\\n\\nabout four more days, if we don\\'t have any accidents.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And how deep do you think it is?\" went on the lad.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m afraid it\\'s pretty close to two miles, if not\\n\\nmore. It\\'s quite a depth, and of course impossible for\\n\\nordinary divers to reach. But it will be possible in this\\n\\nsubmarine and in the strong diving suits your father has\\n\\ninvented for us to get to it. Yes, I don\\'t anticipate much\\n\\ntrouble in getting out the gold, once we reach the wreck of\\n\\ncourse--\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe captain\\'s remark was not finished. From the engine-\\n\\nroom there came a startled shout:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Tom! Tom! Your father is hurt! Come here, quick!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Take the wheel!\" cried the lad to the captain. \"I must go\\n\\nto my father.\" It was Mr. Sharp\\'s voice he had heard.\\n\\n\\n\\nRacing to the engine-room, Tom saw his parent doubled up\\n\\nover a dynamo, while to one side, his hand on a copper\\n\\nswitch, stood Mr. Sharp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" shouted the lad.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He\\'s held there by a current of electricity,\" replied the\\n\\nballoonist. \"The wires are crossed.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you shut off the current?\" demanded the youth,\\n\\nas he prepared to pull his parent from the whirring machine.\\n\\nThen he hesitated, for he feared he, too, would be glued\\n\\nfast by the terrible current, and so be unable to help Mr.\\n\\nSwift.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m held fast here, too,\" replied the balloonist. \"I\\n\\nstarted to cut out the current at this switch, but there\\'s a\\n\\nshort circuit somewhere, and I can\\'t let go, either. Quick,\\n\\nshut off all power at the main switchboard forward.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom realized that this was the only thing to do. He ran\\n\\nforward and with a yank cut out all the electric wires. With\\n\\na sigh of relief Mr. Sharp pulled his hands from the copper\\n\\nwhere he had been held fast as if by some powerful magnet,\\n\\nhis muscles cramped by the current. Fortunately the\\n\\nelectricity was of low voltage, and he was not burned. The\\n\\nbody of Mr. Swift toppled backward from the dynamo, as Tom\\n\\nsprang to reach his father.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He\\'s dead!\" he cried, as he saw the pale face and the\\n\\nclosed eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, only badly shocked, I hope,\" spoke Mr. Sharp. \"But we\\n\\nmust get him to the fresh air at once. Start the tank pumps.\\n\\nWe\\'ll rise to the surface.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe youth needed no second bidding. Once more turning on\\n\\nthe electric current, he set the powerful pumps in motion\\n\\nand the submarine began to rise. Then, aided by Captain\\n\\nWeston and Mr. Damon, the young inventor carried his father\\n\\nto a couch in the main cabin. Mr. Sharp took charge of the\\n\\nmachinery.\\n\\n\\n\\nRestoratives were applied, and there was a flutter of the\\n\\neyelids of the aged inventor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I think he\\'ll come around all right,\" said the sailor\\n\\nkindly, as he saw Tom\\'s grief. \"Fresh air will be the thing\\n\\nfor him. We\\'ll be on the surface in a minute.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nUp shot the Advance, while Mr. Sharp stood ready to open\\n\\nthe conning tower as soon as it should be out of water. Mr.\\n\\nSwift seemed to be rapidly reviving. With a bound the\\n\\nsubmarine, forced upward from the great depth, fairly shot\\n\\nout of the water. There was a clanking sound as the aeronaut\\n\\nopened the airtight door of the tower, and a breath of fresh\\n\\nair came in.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Can you walk, dad, or shall we carry you?\" asked Tom\\n\\nsolitiously.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, I--I\\'m feeling better now,\" was the inventor\\'s reply.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll soon be all right when I get out on deck. My foot\\n\\nslipped as I was adjusting a wire that had gotten out of\\n\\norder, and I fell so that I received a large part of the\\n\\ncurrent. I\\'m glad I was not burned. Was Mr. Sharp hurt? I\\n\\nsaw him run to the switch, just before I lost\\n\\nconsciousness.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, I\\'m all right,\" answered the balloonist. \"But allow\\n\\nus to get you out to the fresh air. You\\'ll feel much better\\n\\nthen.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Swift managed to walk slowly to the ladder leading to\\n\\nthe conning tower, and thence to the deck. The others\\n\\nfollowed him. As all emerged from the submarine they uttered\\n\\na cry of astonishment.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere, not one hundred yards away, was a great warship,\\n\\nflying a flag which, in a moment. Tom recognized as that of\\n\\nBrazil. The cruiser was lying off a small island, and all\\n\\nabout were small boats, filled with natives, who seemed to\\n\\nbe bringing supplies from land to the ship. At the\\n\\nunexpected sight of the submarine, bobbing up from the\\n\\nbottom of the ocean, the natives uttered cries of fright.\\n\\nThe attention of those on the warship was attracted, and the\\n\\nbridge and rails were lined with curious officers and men.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s a good thing we didn\\'t come up under that ship,\"\\n\\nobserved Tom. \"They would have thought we were trying to\\n\\ntorpedo her. Do you feel better, dad?\" he asked, his wonder\\n\\nover the sight of the big vessel temporarily eclipsed in his\\n\\nanxiety for his parent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, much better. I\\'m all right now. But I wish we\\n\\nhadn\\'t disclosed ourselves to these people. They may demand\\n\\nto know where we are going, and Brazil is too near Uruguay\\n\\nto make it safe to tell our errand. They may guess it,\\n\\nhowever, from having read of the wreck, and our departure.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, I guess it will be all right,\" replied Captain\\n\\nWeston. \"We can tell them we are on a pleasure trip. That\\'s\\n\\ntrue enough. It would give us great pleasure to find that\\n\\ngold.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There\\'s a boat, with some officers in it, to judge by the\\n\\namount of gold lace on them, putting off from the ship,\"\\n\\nremarked Mr. Sharp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ha! Yes! Evidently they intend to pay us a formal visit,\"\\n\\nobserved Mr. Damon. \"Bless my gaiters, though. I\\'m not\\n\\ndressed to receive company. I think I\\'ll put on my dress\\n\\nsuit.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s too late,\" advised Tom. \"They\\'ll be here in a\\n\\nminute.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nUrged on by the lusty arms of the Brazilian sailors, the\\n\\nboat, containing several officers, neared the floating\\n\\nsubmarine rapidly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ahoy there!\" called an officer in the bow, his accent\\n\\nbetraying his unfamiliarity with the English language. \"What\\n\\ncraft are you?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Submarine, Advance, from New Jersey,\" replied Tom. \"Who\\n\\nare you?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Brazilian cruiser San Paulo,\" was the reply. \"Where are\\n\\nyou bound?\" went on the officer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"On pleasure,\" answered Captain Weston quickly. \"But why\\n\\ndo you ask? We are an American ship, sailing under American\\n\\ncolors. Is this Brazilian territory?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"This island is--yes,\" came back the answer, and by this\\n\\ntime the small boat was at the side of the submarine. Before\\n\\nthe adventurers could have protested, had they a desire to\\n\\ndo so, there were a number of officers and the crew of the\\n\\nSan Paulo on the small deck.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith a flourish, the officer who had done the questioning\\n\\ndrew his sword. Waving it in the air with a dramatic\\n\\ngesture, he exclaimed:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'re our prisoners! Resist and my men shall cut you\\n\\ndown like dogs! Seize them, men!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sailors sprang forward, each one stationing himself at\\n\\nthe side of one of our friends, and grasping an arm.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What does this mean?\" cried Captain Weston indignantly.\\n\\n\"If this is a joke, you\\'re carrying it too far. If you\\'re in\\n\\nearnest, let me warn you against interfering with\\n\\nAmericans!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We know what we are doing,\" was the answer from the\\n\\nofficer.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sailor who had hold of Captain Weston endeavored to\\n\\nsecure a tighter grip. The captain turned suddenly, and\\n\\nseizing the man about the waist, with an exercise of\\n\\ntremendous strength hurled him over his head and into the\\n\\nsea, the man making a great splash.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s the way I\\'ll treat any one else who dares lay a\\n\\nhand on me!\" shouted the captain, who was transformed from a\\n\\nmild-mannered individual into an angry, modern giant. There\\n\\nwas a gasp of astonishment at his feat, as the ducked sailor\\n\\ncrawled back into the small boat. And he did not again\\n\\nventure on the deck of the submarine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Seize them, men!\" cried the gold-laced officer again, and\\n\\nthis time he and his fellows, including the crew, crowded so\\n\\nclosely around Tom and his friends that they could do\\n\\nnothing. Even Captain Weston found it impossible to offer\\n\\nany resistance, for three men grabbed hold of him but his\\n\\nspirit was still a fighting one, and he struggled\\n\\ndesperately but uselessly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"How dare you do this?\" he cried.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes,\" added Tom, \"what right have you to interfere with\\n\\nus?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Every right,\" declared the gold-laced officer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You are in Brazilian territory, and I arrest you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What for?\" demanded Mr. Sharp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Because your ship is an American submarine, and we have\\n\\nreceived word that you intend to damage our shipping, and\\n\\nmay try to torpedo our warships. I believe you tried to\\n\\ndisable us a little while ago, but failed. We consider that\\n\\nan act of war and you will be treated accordingly. Take them\\n\\non board the San Paulo,\" the officer Went on, turning to his\\n\\naides. \"We\\'ll try them by court-marital here. Some of you\\n\\nremain and guard this submarine. We will teach these\\n\\nfilibustering Americans a lesson.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Twenty\\n\\n\\n\\nDoomed to Death\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was no room on the small deck of the submarine to\\n\\nmake a stand against the officers and crew of the Brazilian\\n\\nwarship. In fact, the capture of the gold-seekers had been\\n\\neffected so suddenly that their astonishment almost deprived\\n\\nthem of the power to think clearly.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt another command from the officer, who was addressed as\\n\\nAdmiral Fanchetti, several of the sailors began to lead Tom\\n\\nand his friends toward the small boat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Do you feel all right, father?\" inquired the lad\\n\\nanxiously, as he looked at his parent. \"These scoundrels\\n\\nhave no right to treat us so.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, Tom, I\\'m all right as far as the electric shock is\\n\\nconcerned, but I don\\'t like to be handled in this fashion.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We ought not to submit!\" burst out Mr. Damon. \"Bless the\\n\\nstars and stripes! We ought to fight.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There\\'s no chance,\" said Mr. Sharp. \"We are right under\\n\\nthe guns of the ship. They could sink us with one shot. I\\n\\nguess we\\'ll have to give in for the time being.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It is most unpleasant, if I may be allowed the\\n\\nexpression,\" commented Captain Weston mildly. He seemed to\\n\\nhave lost his sudden anger, hut there was a steely glint in\\n\\nhis eyes, and a grim, set look around his month that showed\\n\\nhis temper was kept under control only by an effort. It\\n\\nboded no good to the sailors who had hold of the doughty\\n\\ncaptain if he should once get loose, and it was noticed that\\n\\nthey were on their guard.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs for Tom, he submitted quietly to the two Brazilians who\\n\\nhad hold of either arm, and Mr. Swift was held by only one,\\n\\nfor it was seen that he was feeble.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Into the boat with them!\" cried Admiral Fanchetti. \"And\\n\\nguard them well, Lieutenant Drascalo, for I heard them\\n\\nplotting to escape,\" and the admiral signaled to a younger\\n\\nofficer, who was in charge of the men guarding the\\n\\nprisoners.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Lieutenant Drascalo, eh?\" murmured Mr. Damon. \"I think\\n\\nthey made a mistake naming him. It ought to be Rascalo. He\\n\\nlooks like a rascal.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Silenceo!\" exclaimed the lieutenant, scowling at the odd\\n\\ncharacter\\'.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my spark plug! He\\'s a regular fire-eater!\" went on\\n\\nMr. Damon, who appeared to have fully recovered his spirits.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Silenceo!\" cried the lieutenant, scowling again, but Mr.\\n\\nDamon did not appear to mind.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdmiral Fanchetti and several others of the gold-laced\\n\\nofficers remained aboard the submarine, while Tom and his\\n\\nfriends were hustled into the small boat and rowed toward\\n\\nthe warship.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I hope they don\\'t damage our craft,\" murmured the young\\n\\ninventor, as he saw the admiral enter the conning tower.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If they do, we\\'ll complain to the United States consul\\n\\nand demand damages,\" said Mr. Swift\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid we won\\'t have a chance to communicate with the\\n\\nconsul,\" remarked Captain Weston.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Mr. Damon. \"Bless my shoelaces,\\n\\nbut will these scoundrels--\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Silenceo!\" cried Lieutenant Drascalo quickly. \"Dogs of\\n\\nAmericans, do you wish to insult us?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Impossible; you wouldn\\'t appreciate a good, genuine\\n\\nUnited States insult,\" murmured Tom under his breath.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What I mean,\" went on the captain, \"is that these people\\n\\nmay carry the proceedings off with a high hand. You heard\\n\\nthe admiral speak of a court-martial.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Would they dare do that?\" inquired Mr. Sharp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They would dare anything in this part of the world, I\\'m\\n\\nafraid,\" resumed Captain Weston. \"I think I see their plan,\\n\\nthough. This admiral is newly in command; his uniform shows\\n\\nthat He wants to make a name for himself, and he seizes on\\n\\nour submarine as an excuse. He can send word to his\\n\\ngovernment that he destroyed a torpedo craft that sought to\\n\\nwreck his ship. Thus he will acquire a reputation.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But would his government support him in such a hostile\\n\\nact against the United States, a friendly nation?\" asked\\n\\nTom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, he would not claim to have acted against the United\\n\\nStates as a power. He would say that it was a private\\n\\nsubmarine, and, as a matter of fact, it is. While we are\\n\\nunder the protection of the stars and stripes, our vessel is\\n\\nnot a Government one,\" and Captain Weston spoke the last in\\n\\na low voice, so the scowling lieutenant could not hear.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What will they do with us?\" inquired Mr. Swift.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Have some sort of a court-martial, perhaps,\" went on the\\n\\ncaptain, \"and confiscate our craft Then they will send us\\n\\nback home, I expect for they would not dare harm us.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But take our submarine!\" cried Tom. \"The villains--\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Silenceo!\" shouted Lieutenant Drascalo and he drew his\\n\\nsword.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy this time the small boat was under the big guns of the\\n\\nSan Paulo, and the prisoners were ordered, in broken\\n\\nEnglish, to mount a companion ladder that hung over the\\n\\nside. In a short time they were on deck, amid a crowd of\\n\\nsailors, and they could see the boat going back to bring off\\n\\nthe admiral, who signaled from the submarine. Tom and his\\n\\nfriends were taken below to a room that looked like a\\n\\nprison, and there, a little later, they were visited by\\n\\nAdmiral Fanchetti and several officers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You will be tried at once,\" said the admiral. \"I have\\n\\nexamined your submarine and I find she carries two torpedo\\n\\ntubes. It is a wonder you did not sink me at once.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Those are not torpedo tubes!\" cried Tom, unable to keep\\n\\nsilent, though Captain Weston motioned him to do so.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I know torpedo tubes when I see them,\" declared the\\n\\nadmiral. \"I consider I had a very narrow escape. Your\\n\\ncountry is fortunate that mine does not declare war against\\n\\nit for this act. But I take it you are acting privately, for\\n\\nyou fly no flag, though you claim to be from the United\\n\\nStates.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There\\'s no place for a flag on the submarine,\" went on\\n\\nTom. \"What good would it be under water?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Silenceo!\" cried Lieutenant Drascalo, the admonition to\\n\\nsilence seeming to be the only command of which he was\\n\\ncapable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I shall confiscate your craft for my government,\" went on\\n\\nthe admiral, \"and shall punish you as the court-martial may\\n\\ndirect. You will be tried at once.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was in vain for the prisoners to protest. Matters were\\n\\ncarried with a high hand. They were allowed a spokesman, and\\n\\nCaptain Weston, who understood Spanish, was selected, that\\n\\nlanguage being used. But the defense was a farce, for he was\\n\\nscarcely listened to. Several officers testified before the\\n\\nadmiral, who was judge, that they had seen the submarine\\n\\nrise out of the water, almost under the prow of the San\\n\\nPaulo. It was assumed that the Advance had tried to wreck\\n\\nthe warship, but had failed. It was in vain that Captain\\n\\nWeston and the others told of the reason for their rapid\\n\\nascent from the ocean depths--that Mr. Swift had been\\n\\nshocked, and needed fresh air. Their story was not believed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We have heard enough!\" suddenly exclaimed the admiral.\\n\\n\"The evidence against you is over-whelming--er--what you\\n\\nAmericans call conclusive,\" and be was speaking then in\\n\\nbroken English. \"I find you guilty, and the sentence of this\\n\\ncourt-martial is that you be shot at sunrise, three days\\n\\nhence!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Shot!\" cried Captain Weston, staggering back at this\\n\\nunexpected sentence. His companions turned white, and Mr.\\n\\nSwift leaned against his son for support.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my stars! Of all the scoundrelly!\" began Mr. Damon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Silenceo!\" shouted the lieutenant, waving his sword.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You will be shot,\" proceeded the admiral. \"Is not that\\n\\nthe verdict of the honorable court?\" he asked, looking at\\n\\nhis fellow officers. They all nodded gravely.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But look here!\" objected Captain Weston. \"You don\\'t dare\\n\\ndo that! We are citizens of the United States, and--\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I consider you no better than pirates,\" interrupted the\\n\\nadmiral. \"You have an armed submarine--a submarine with\\n\\ntorpedo tubes. You invade our harbor with it, and come up\\n\\nalmost under my ship. You have forfeited your right to the\\n\\nprotection of your country, and I have no fear on that\\n\\nscore. You will be shot within three days. That is all.\\n\\nRemove the prisoners.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nProtests were in vain, and it was equally useless to\\n\\nstruggle. The prisoners were taken out on deck, for which\\n\\nthey were thankful, for the interior of the ship was close\\n\\nand hot, the weather being intensely disagreeable. They were\\n\\ntold to keep within a certain space on deck, and a guard of\\n\\nsailors, all armed, was placed near them. From where they\\n\\nwere they could see their submarine floating on the surface\\n\\nof the little bay, with several Brazilians on the small\\n\\ndeck. The Advance had been anchored, and was surrounded by a\\n\\nflotilla of the native boats, the brown-skinned paddlers\\n\\ngazing curiously at the odd craft.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, this is tough luck!\" murmured Tom. \"How do you\\n\\nfeel, dad?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"As well as can be expected under the circumstances,\" was\\n\\nthe reply. \"What do you think about this, Captain Weston?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not very much, if I may be allowed the expression,\" was\\n\\nthe answer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Do you think they will dare carry out that threat?\" asked\\n\\nMr. Sharp.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe captain shrugged his shoulders. \"I hope it is only a\\n\\nbluff,\" he replied, \"made to scare us so we will consent to\\n\\ngiving up the submarine, which they have no right to\\n\\nconfiscate. But these fellows look ugly enough for\\n\\nanything,\" he went on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then if there\\'s any chance of them attempting to carry it\\n\\nout,\" spoke Tom, \"we\\'ve got to do something.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my gizzard, of course!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"But\\n\\nwhat? That\\'s the question. To be shot! Why, that\\'s a\\n\\nterrible threat! The villains--\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Silenceo!\" shouted Lieutenant Drascalo, coming up at that\\n\\nmoment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Twenty-One\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Escape\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvents had happened so quickly that day that the gold-\\n\\nhunters could scarcely comprehend them. It seemed only a\\n\\nshort time since Mr. Swift had been discovered lying\\n\\ndisabled on the dynamo, and what had transpired since seemed\\n\\nto have taken place in a few minutes, though it was, in\\n\\nreality, several hours. This was made manifest by the\\n\\nfeeling of hunger on the part of Tom and his friends.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I wonder if they\\'re going to starve us, the scoundrels?\"\\n\\nasked Mr. Sharp, when the irate lieutenant was beyond\\n\\nhearing. \"It\\'s not fair to make us go hungry and shoot us in\\n\\nthe bargain.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s so, they ought to feed us,\" put in Tom. As yet\\n\\nneither he nor the others fully realized the meaning of the\\n\\nsentence passed on them.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom where they were on deck they could look off to the\\n\\nlittle island. From it boats manned by natives were\\n\\nconstantly putting off, bringing supplies to the ship. The\\n\\nplace appeared to be a sort of calling station for Brazilian\\n\\nwarships, where they could get fresh water and fruit and\\n\\nother food.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom the island the gaze of the adventurers wandered to\\n\\nthe submarine, which lay not far away. They were chagrined\\n\\nto see several of the bolder natives clambering over the\\n\\ndeck.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I hope they keep out of the interior,\" commented Tom. \"If\\n\\nthey get to pulling or hauling on the levers and wheels they\\n\\nmay open the tanks and sink her, with the Conning tower\\n\\nopen.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Better that, perhaps, than to have her fall into the\\n\\nhands of a foreign power,\" commented Captain Weston.\\n\\n\"Besides, I don\\'t see that it\\'s going to matter much to us\\n\\nwhat becomes of her after we\\'re--\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe did not finish, but every one knew what he meant, and a\\n\\ngrim silence fell upon the little group.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere came a welcome diversion, however, in the shape of\\n\\nthree sailors, bearing trays of food, which were placed on\\n\\nthe deck in front of the prisoners, who were sitting or\\n\\nlying in the shade of an awning, for the sun was very hot\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ha! Bless my napkin-ring!\" cried Mr. Damon with something\\n\\nof his former gaiety. \"Here\\'s a meal, at all events. They\\n\\ndon\\'t intend to starve us. Eat hearty, every one.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, we need to keep up our strength,\" observed Captain\\n\\nWeston.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why?\" inquired Mr. Sharp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Because we\\'re going to try to escape!\" exclaimed Tom in a\\n\\nlow voice, when the sailors who had brought the food had\\n\\ngone. \"Isn\\'t that what you mean, captain?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Exactly. We\\'ll try to give these villains the slip, and\\n\\nwe\\'ll need all our strength and wits to do it. We\\'ll wait\\n\\nuntil night, and see what we can do.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But where will we escape to?\" asked Mr. Swift. \"The\\n\\nisland will afford no shelter, and--\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, but our submarine will,\" went on the sailor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s in the possession of the Brazilians,\" objected Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Once I get aboard the Advance twenty of those brown-\\n\\nskinned villains won\\'t keep me prisoner,\" declared Captain\\n\\nWeston fiercely. \"If we can only slip away from here, get\\n\\ninto the small boat, or even swim to the submarine, I\\'ll\\n\\nmake those chaps on board her think a hurricane has broken\\n\\nloose.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, and I\\'ll help,\" said Mr. Damon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And I,\" added Tom and the balloonist\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s the way to talk,\" commented the captain. \"Now\\n\\nlet\\'s eat, for I see that rascally lieutenant coming this\\n\\nway, and we mustn\\'t appear to be plotting, or he\\'ll be\\n\\nsuspicious.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe day passed slowly, and though the prisoners seemed to\\n\\nbe allowed considerable liberty, they soon found that it was\\n\\nonly apparent. Once Tom walked some distance from that\\n\\nportion of the deck where he and the others had been told to\\n\\nremain. A sailor with a gun at once ordered him back. Nor\\n\\ncould they approach the rails without being directed,\\n\\nharshly enough at times, to move back amidships.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs night approached the gold-seekers were on the alert for\\n\\nany chance that might offer to slip away, or even attack\\n\\ntheir guard, but the number of Brazilians around them was\\n\\ndoubled in the evening, and after supper, which was served\\n\\nto them on deck by the light of swinging lanterns, they were\\n\\ntaken below and locked in a stuffy cabin. They looked\\n\\nhelplessly at each other.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Don\\'t give up,\" advised Captain Weston. \"It\\'s a long\\n\\nnight. We may be able to get out of here.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut this hope was in vain. Several times he and Tom,\\n\\nthinking the guards outside the cabin were asleep, tried to\\n\\nforce the lock of the door with their pocket-knives, which\\n\\nhad not been taken from them. But one of the sailors was\\n\\naroused each time by the noise, and looked in through a\\n\\nbarred window, so they had to give it up. Slowly the night\\n\\npassed, and morning found the prisoners pale, tired and\\n\\ndiscouraged. They were brought up on deck again, for which\\n\\nthey were thankful, as in that tropical climate it was\\n\\nstifling below.\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring the day they saw Admiral Fanchetti and several of\\n\\nhis officers pay a visit to the submarine. They went below\\n\\nthrough the opened conning tower, and were gone some time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I hope they don\\'t disturb any of the machinery,\" remarked\\n\\nMr. Swift. \"That could easily do great damage.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAdmiral Fanchetti seemed much pleased with himself when he\\n\\nreturned from his visit to the submarine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You have a fine craft,\" he said to the prisoners. \"Or,\\n\\nrather, you had one. My government now owns it. It seems a\\n\\npity to shoot such good boat builders, but you are too\\n\\ndangerous to be allowed to go.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIf there had been any doubt in the minds of Tom and his\\n\\nfriends that the sentence of the court-martial was only for\\n\\neffect, it was dispelled that day. A firing squad was told\\n\\noff in plain view of them, and the men were put through\\n\\ntheir evolutions by Lieutenant Drascalo, who had them load,\\n\\naim and fire blank cartridges at an imaginary line of\\n\\nprisoners. Tom could not repress a shudder as he noted the\\n\\nleveled rifles, and saw the fire and smoke spurt from the\\n\\nmuzzles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thus we shall do to you at sunrise to-morrow,\" said the\\n\\nlieutenant, grinning, as he once more had his men practice\\n\\ntheir grim work.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt seemed hotter than ever that day. The sun was fairly\\n\\nbroiling, and there was a curious haziness and stillness to\\n\\nthe air. It was noticed that the sailors on the San Paula\\n\\nwere busy making fast all loose articles on deck with extra\\n\\nlashings, and hatch coverings were doubly secured.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What do you suppose they are up to?\" asked Tom of Captain\\n\\nWeston.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I think it is coming on to blow,\" he replied, \"and they\\n\\ndon\\'t want to be caught napping. They have fearful storms\\n\\ndown in this region at this season of the year, and I think\\n\\none is about due.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I hope it doesn\\'t wreck the submarine,\" spoke Mr. Swift.\\n\\n\"They ought to close the hatch of the conning tower, for it\\n\\nwon\\'t take much of a sea to make her ship considerable\\n\\nwater.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAdmiral Fanchetti had thought of this, however, and as the\\n\\nafternoon wore away and the storm signs multiplied, he sent\\n\\nword to close the submarine. He left a few sailors aboard\\n\\ninside on guard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s too hot to eat,\" observed Tom, when their supper had\\n\\nbeen brought to them, and the others felt the same way about\\n\\nit. They managed to drink some cocoanut milk, prepared in a\\n\\npalatable fashion by the natives of the island, and then,\\n\\nmuch to their disgust, they were taken below again and\\n\\nlocked in the cabin.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Whew! But it certainly is hot!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon as he\\n\\nsat down on a couch and fanned himself. \"This is awful!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, something is going to happen pretty soon,\" observed\\n\\nCaptain Weston. \"The storm will break shortly, I think.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThey sat languidly about the cabin. It was so oppressive\\n\\nthat even the thought of the doom that awaited them in the\\n\\nmorning could hardly seem worse than the terrible heat. They\\n\\ncould hear movements going on about the ship, movements\\n\\nwhich indicated that preparations were being made for\\n\\nsomething unusual. There was a rattling of a chain through a\\n\\nhawse hole, and Captain Weston remarked:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They\\'re putting down another anchor. Admiral Fanchetti\\n\\nhad better get away from the island, though, unless he wants\\n\\nto be wrecked. He\\'ll be blown ashore in less than no time. No\\n\\ncable or chain will hold in such storms as they have here.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThere came a period of silence, which was suddenly broken\\n\\nby a howl as of some wild beast.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\" cried Tom, springing up from where he was\\n\\nstretched out on the cabin floor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Only the wind,\" replied the captain. \"The storm has\\n\\narrived.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe howling kept up, and soon the ship began to rock. The\\n\\nwind increased, and a little later there could be heard,\\n\\nthrough an opened port in the prisoners\\' cabin, the dash of\\n\\nrain.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s a regular hurricane!\" exclaimed the captain. \"I\\n\\nwonder if the cables will hold?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What about the submarine?\" asked Mr. Swift anxiously.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t much fear for her. She lies so low in the water\\n\\nthat the wind can\\'t get much hold on her. I don\\'t believe\\n\\nshe\\'ll drag her anchor.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce more came a fierce burst of wind, and a\\n\\ndash of rain, and then, suddenly above the outburst of the\\n\\nelements, there sounded a crash on deck. It was followed by\\n\\nexcited cries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Something\\'s happened!\" yelled Tom. The prisoners gathered\\n\\nin a frightened group in the middle of the cabin. The cries\\n\\nwere repeated, and then came a rush of feet just outside the\\n\\ncabin door.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Our guards! They\\'re leaving!\" shouted Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Right!\" exclaimed Captain Weston. \"Now\\'s our chance! Come\\n\\non! If we\\'re going to escape we must do it while the storm\\n\\nis at its height, and all is in confusion. Come on!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom tried the door. It was locked.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"One side!\" shouted the captain, and this time he did not\\n\\npause to say \"by your leave.\" He came at the portal on the\\n\\nrun, and his shoulder struck it squarely. There was a\\n\\nsplintering and crashing of wood, and the door was burst\\n\\nopen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Follow me!\" cried the valiant sailor, and Tom and the\\n\\nothers rushed after him. They could hear the wind howling\\n\\nmore loudly than ever, and as they reached the deck the rain\\n\\ndashed into their faces with such violence that they could\\n\\nhardly see. But they were aware that something had occurred.\\n\\nBy the light of several lanterns swaying in the terrific\\n\\nblast they saw that one of the auxiliary masts had broken\\n\\noff near the deck.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt had fallen against the chart house, smashing it, and a\\n\\nnumber of sailors were laboring to clear away the wreckage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Fortune favors us!\" cried Captain Weston. \"Come on! Make\\n\\nfor the small boat. It\\'s near the side ladder. We\\'ll lower\\n\\nthe boat and pull to the submarine.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThere came a flash of lightning, and in its glare Tom saw\\n\\nsomething that caused him to cry out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Look!\" he shouted. \"The submarine. She\\'s dragged her\\n\\nanchors!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Advance was much closer to the warship than she had\\n\\nbeen that afternoon. Captain Weston looked over the side.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s the San Paula that\\'s dragging her anchors, not the\\n\\nsubmarine!\" he shouted. \"We\\'re bearing down on her! We must\\n\\nact quickly. Come on, we\\'ll lower the boat!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the rush of wind and the dash of rain the prisoners\\n\\ncrowded to the accommodation companion ladder, which was\\n\\nstill over the side of the big ship. No one seemed to be\\n\\nnoticing them, for Admiral Fanchetti was on the bridge,\\n\\nyelling orders for the clearing away of the wreckage. But\\n\\nLieutenant Drascalo, coming up from below at that moment,\\n\\ncaught sight of the fleeing ones. Drawing his sword, he\\n\\nrushed at them, shouting:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The prisoners! The prisoners! They are escaping!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCaptain Weston leaped toward the lieutenant\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Look out for his sword!\" cried Tom. But the doughty\\n\\nsailor did not fear the weapon. Catching up a coil of rope,\\n\\nhe cast it at the lieutenant. It struck him in the chest,\\n\\nand he staggered back, lowering his sword.\\n\\n\\n\\nCaptain Weston leaped forward, and with a terrific blow\\n\\nsent Lieutenant Drascalo to the deck.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There!\" cried the sailor. \"I guess you won\\'t yell\\n\\n\\'Silenceo!\\' for a while now.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a rush of Brazilians toward the group of\\n\\nprisoners. Tom caught one with a blow on the chin, and\\n\\nfelled him, while Captain Weston disposed of two more, and\\n\\nMr. Sharp and Mr. Damon one each. The savage fighting of the\\n\\nAmericans was too much for the foreigners, and they drew\\n\\nback.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Come on!\" cried Captain Weston again. \"The storm is\\n\\ngetting worse. The warship will crash into the submarine in\\n\\na few minutes. Her anchors aren\\'t holding. I didn\\'t think\\n\\nthey would.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe made a dash for the ladder, and a glance showed him\\n\\nthat the small boat was in the water at the foot of it. The\\n\\ncraft had not been hoisted on the davits.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Luck\\'s with us at last!\" cried Tom, Seeing it also.\\n\\n\"Shall I help you, dad?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No; I think I\\'m all right. Go ahead.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThere came such a gust of wind that the San Paula was\\n\\nheeled over, and the wreck of the mast, rolling about,\\n\\ncrashed into the side of a deck house, splintering it. A\\n\\ncrowd of sailors, led by Admiral Fanchetti, who were again\\n\\nrushing on the escaping prisoners, had to leap back out of\\n\\nthe way of the rolling mast.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Catch them! Don\\'t let them get away!\" begged the\\n\\ncommander, but the sailors evidently had no desire to close\\n\\nin with the Americans.\\n\\n\\n\\nThrough the rush of wind and rain Tom and his friends\\n\\nstaggered down the ladder. It was hard work to maintain\\n\\none\\'s footing, but they managed it. On account of the high\\n\\nside of the ship the water was comparatively calm under her\\n\\nlee, and, though the small boat was bobbing about, they got\\n\\naboard. The oars were in place, and in another moment they\\n\\nhad shoved off from the landing stage which formed the foot\\n\\nof the accommodation ladder.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Now for the Advance!\" murmured Captain Weston.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Come back! Come back, dogs of Americans!\" cried a voice\\n\\nat the rail over their heads, and looking up, Tom saw\\n\\nLieutenant Drascalo. He had snatched a carbine from a\\n\\nmarine, and was pointing it at the recent prisoners. He\\n\\nfired, the flash of the gun and a dazzling chain of\\n\\nlightning coming together. The thunder swallowed up the\\n\\nreport of the carbine, but the bullet whistled uncomfortable\\n\\nclose to Tom\\'s head. The blackness that followed the\\n\\nlightning shut out the view of everything for a few seconds,\\n\\nand when the next flash came the adventurers saw that they\\n\\nwere close to their submarine.\\n\\n\\n\\nA fusillade of shots sounded from the deck of the warship,\\n\\nbut as the marines were poor marksmen at best, and as the\\n\\nswaying of the ship disconcerted them, our friends were in\\n\\nlittle danger.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was quite a sea once they were beyond the protection\\n\\nof the side of the warship, but Captain Weston, who was\\n\\nrowing, knew how to manage a boat skillfully, and he soon had\\n\\nthe craft alongside the bobbing submarine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Get aboard, now, quick!\" he cried.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey leaped to the small deck, casting the rowboat adrift.\\n\\nIt was the work of but a moment to open the conning tower.\\n\\nAs they started to descend they were met by several\\n\\nBrazilians coming up.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Overboard with \\'em!\" yelled the captain. \"Let them swim\\n\\nashore or to their ship!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWith almost superhuman strength he tossed one big sailor\\n\\nfrom the small deck. Another showed fight, but he went to\\n\\njoin his companion in the swirling water. A man rushed at\\n\\nTom, seeking the while to draw his sword, but the young\\n\\ninventor, with a neat left-hander, sent him to join the\\n\\nother two, and the remainder did not wait to try\\n\\nconclusions. They leaped for their lives, and soon all could\\n\\nbe seen, in the frequent lightning flashes, swimming toward\\n\\nthe warship which was now closer than ever to the submarine\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Get inside and we\\'ll sink below the surface!\" called Tom.\\n\\n\"Then we don\\'t care what happens.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThey closed the steel door of the conning tower. As they\\n\\ndid so they heard the patter of bullets from carbines fired\\n\\nfrom the San Paulo. Then came a violent tossing of the\\n\\nAdvance; the waves were becoming higher as they caught the\\n\\nfull force of the hurricane. It took but an instant to\\n\\nsever, from within, the cable attached to the anchor, which\\n\\nwas one belonging to the warship. The Advance began\\n\\ndrifting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Open the tanks, Mr. Sharp!\" cried Tom. \"Captain Weston\\n\\nand I will steer. Once below we\\'ll start the engines.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAmid a crash of thunder and dazzling flashes of lightning,\\n\\nthe submarine began to sink. Tom, in the conning tower had a\\n\\nsight of the San Paulo as it drifted nearer and nearer under\\n\\nthe influence of the mighty wind. As one bright flash came\\n\\nhe saw Admiral Fanchetti and Lieutenant Drascalo leaning\\n\\nover the rail and gazing at the Advance.\\n\\n\\n\\nA moment later the view faded from sight as the submarine\\n\\nsank below the surface of the troubled sea. She was tossed\\n\\nabout for some time until deep enough to escape the surface\\n\\nmotion. Waiting until she was far enough down so that her\\n\\nlights would not offer a mark for the guns of the warship,\\n\\nthe electrics were switched on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We\\'re safe now!\" cried Tom, helping his father to his\\n\\ncabin. \"They\\'ve got too much to attend to themselves to\\n\\nfollow us now, even if they could. Shall we go ahead,\\n\\nCaptain Weston?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I think so, yes, if I may be allowed to express my\\n\\nopinion,\" was the mild reply, in strange contrast to the\\n\\nstrenuous work in which the captain had just been engaged.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom signaled to Mr. Sharp in the engine-room, and in a few\\n\\nseconds the Advance was speeding away from the island and\\n\\nthe hostile vessel. Nor, deep as she was now, was there any\\n\\nsign of the hurricane. In the peaceful depths she was once\\n\\nmore speeding toward the sunken treasure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Twenty-Two\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the Wreck\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" remarked Mr. Damon, as the submarine hurled\\n\\nherself forward through the ocean, \"I guess that firing\\n\\nparty will have something else to do to-morrow morning\\n\\nbesides aiming those rifles at us.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed,\" agreed Tom. \"They\\'ll be lucky if they save\\n\\ntheir ship. My, how that wind did blow!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'re right,\" put in Captain Weston. \"When they get a\\n\\nhurricane down in this region it\\'s no cat\\'s paw. But they\\n\\nwere a mighty careless lot of sailors. The idea of leaving\\n\\nthe ladder over the side, and the boat in the water.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It was a good thing for us, though,\" was Tom\\'s opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Indeed it was,\" came from the captain. \"But as long as we\\n\\nare safe now I think we\\'d better take a look about the craft\\n\\nto see if those chaps did any damage. They can\\'t have done\\n\\nmuch, though, or she wouldn\\'t be running so smoothly.\\n\\nSuppose you go take a look, Tom, and ask your father and Mr.\\n\\nSharp what they think. I\\'ll steer for a while, until we get\\n\\nwell away from the island.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe young inventor found his father and the balloonist\\n\\nbusy in the engine-room. Mr. Swift had already begun an\\n\\ninspection of the machinery, and so far found that it had\\n\\nnot been injured. A further inspection showed that no damage\\n\\nhad been done by the foreign guard that had been in\\n\\ntemporary possession of the Advance, though the sailors had\\n\\nmade free in the cabins, and had broken into the food\\n\\nlockers, helping themselves plentifully. But there was still\\n\\nenough for the gold-seekers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'d never know there was a storm raging up above,\"\\n\\nobserved Tom as he rejoined Captain Weston in the lower\\n\\npilot house, where he was managing the craft. \"It\\'s as\\n\\nstill and peaceful here as one could wish.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, the extreme depths are seldom disturbed by a surface\\n\\nstorm. But we are over a mile deep now. I sent her down a\\n\\nlittle while you were gone, as I think she rides a little\\n\\nmore steadily.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAll that night they speeded forward, and the next day,\\n\\nrising to the surface to take an observation, they found no\\n\\ntraces of the storm, which had blown itself out. They were\\n\\nseveral hundred miles away from the hostile warship, and\\n\\nthere was not a vessel in sight on the broad expanse of blue\\n\\nocean.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe air tanks were refilled, and after sailing along on\\n\\nthe surface for an hour or two, the submarine was again sent\\n\\nbelow, as Captain Weston sighted through his telescope the\\n\\nsmoke of a distant steamer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"As long as it isn\\'t the Wonder, we\\'re all right,\" said\\n\\nTom. \"Still, we don\\'t want to answer a lot of questions\\n\\nabout ourselves and our object.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No. I fancy the Wonder will give up the search,\" remarked\\n\\nthe captain, as the Advance was sinking to the depths.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We must be getting pretty near to the end of our search\\n\\nourselves,\" ventured the young inventor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We are within five hundred miles of the intersection of\\n\\nthe forty-fifth parallel and the twenty-seventh meridian,\\n\\neast from Washington,\" said the captain. \"That\\'s as near as\\n\\nI could locate the wreck. Once we reach that point we will\\n\\nhave to search about under water, for I don\\'t fancy the\\n\\nother divers left any buoys to mark the spot.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was two days later, after uneventful sailing, partly on\\n\\nthe surface, and partly submerged, that Captain Weston,\\n\\ntaking a noon observation, announced:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, we\\'re here!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Do you mean at the wreck?\" asked Mr. Swift eagerly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We\\'re at the place where she is supposed to lie, in about\\n\\ntwo miles of water,\" replied the captain. \"We are quite a\\n\\ndistance off the coast of Uruguay, about opposite the harbor\\n\\nof Rio de La Plata. From now on we shall have to nose about\\n\\nunder water, and trust to luck.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWith her air tanks filled to their capacity, and Tom\\n\\nhaving seen that the oxygen machine and other apparatus was\\n\\nin perfect working order, the submarine was sent below on\\n\\nher search. Though they were in the neighborhood of the\\n\\nwreck, the adventurers might still have to do considerable\\n\\nsearching before locating it. Lower and lower they sank into\\n\\nthe depths of the sea, down and down, until they were deeper\\n\\nthan they had ever gone before. The pressure was tremendous,\\n\\nbut the steel sides of the Advance withstood it\\n\\n\\n\\nThen began a search that lasted nearly a week. Back and\\n\\nforth they cruised, around in great circles, with the\\n\\npowerful searchlight focused to disclose the sunken treasure\\n\\nship. Once Tom, who was observing the path of light in the\\n\\ndepths from the conning tower, thought he had seen the\\n\\nremains of the Boldero, for a misty shape loomed up in front\\n\\nof the submarine, and he signaled for a quick stop. It was a\\n\\nwreck, but it had been on the ocean bed for a score of\\n\\nyears, and only a few timbers remained of what had been a\\n\\ngreat ship. Much disappointed, Tom rang for full speed ahead\\n\\nagain, and the current was sent into the great electric\\n\\nplates that pulled and pushed the submarine forward.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor two days more nothing happened. They searched around\\n\\nunder the green waters, on the alert for the first sign, but\\n\\nthey saw nothing. Great fish swam about them, sometimes\\n\\nracing with the Advance. The adventurers beheld great ocean\\n\\ncaverns, and skirted immense rocks, where dwelt monsters of\\n\\nthe deep. Once a great octopus tried to do battle with the\\n\\nsubmarine and crush it in its snaky arms, but Tom saw the\\n\\ngreat white body, with saucer-shaped eyes, in the path of\\n\\nlight and rammed him with the steel point. The creature died\\n\\nafter a struggle.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey were beginning to despair when a full week had passed\\n\\nand they were seemingly as far from the wreck as ever. They\\n\\nwent to the surface to enable Captain Weston to take another\\n\\nobservation. It only confirmed the other, and showed that\\n\\nthey were in the right vicinity. But it was like looking for\\n\\na needle in a haystack, almost, to and the sunken ship in\\n\\nthat depth of water.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, we\\'ll try again,\" said Mr. Swift, as they sank once\\n\\nmore beneath the surface.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was toward evening, on the second day after this, that\\n\\nTom, who was on duty in the conning tower, saw a black shape\\n\\nlooming up in front of the submarine, the searchlight\\n\\nrevealing it to him far enough away so that he could steer\\n\\nto avoid it. He thought at first that it was a great rock,\\n\\nfor they were moving along near the bottom, but the peculiar\\n\\nshape of it soon convinced him that this could not be. It\\n\\ncame more plainly into view as the submarine approached it\\n\\nmore slowly, then suddenly, out of the depths in the\\n\\nillumination from the searchlight, the young inventor saw\\n\\nthe steel sides of a steamer. His heart gave a great thump,\\n\\nbut he would not call out yet, fearing that it might be some\\n\\nother vessel than the one containing the treasure.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe steered the Advance so as to circle it. As he swept\\n\\npast the bows he saw in big letters near the sharp prow the\\n\\nword, Boldero.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The wreck! The wreck!\" he cried, his voice ringing\\n\\nthrough the craft from end to end. \"We\\'ve found the wreck at\\n\\nlast!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Are you sure?\" cried his father, hurrying to his son,\\n\\nCaptain Weston following.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Positive,\" answered the lad. The submarine was slowing up\\n\\nnow, and Tom sent her around on the other side. They had a\\n\\ngood view of the sunken ship. It seemed to be intact, no\\n\\ngaping holes in her sides, for only her plates had started,\\n\\nallowing her to sink gradually.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"At last,\" murmured Mr. Swift. \"Can it be possible we are\\n\\nabout to get the treasure?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s the Boldero, all right,\" affirmed Captain Weston.\\n\\n\"I recognize her, even if the name wasn\\'t on her bow. Go\\n\\nright down on the bottom, Tom, and we\\'ll get out the diving\\n\\nsuits and make an examination.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe submarine settled to the ocean bed. Tom glanced at the\\n\\ndepth gage. It showed over two miles and a half. Would they\\n\\nbe able to venture out into water of such enormous pressure\\n\\nin the comparatively frail diving suits, and wrest the gold\\n\\nfrom the wreck? It was a serious question.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Advance came to a stop. In front of her loomed the\\n\\ngreat bulk of the Boldero, vague and shadowy in the\\n\\nflickering gleam of the searchlight As the gold-seekers\\n\\nlooked at her through the bull\\'s-eyes of the conning tower,\\n\\nseveral great forms emerged from beneath the wreck\\'s bows.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Deep-water sharks!\" exclaimed  Captain Weston, \"and\\n\\nmonsters, too. But they can\\'t bother us. Now to get out the\\n\\ngold!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Twenty-Three\\n\\n\\n\\nAttacked by Sharks\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a few minutes after reaching the wreck, which had so\\n\\noccupied their thoughts for the past weeks, the adventurers\\n\\ndid nothing but gaze at it from the ports of the submarine.\\n\\nThe appearance of the deep-water sharks gave them no\\n\\nconcern, for they did not imagine the ugly creatures would\\n\\nattack them. The treasure-seekers were more engrossed with\\n\\nthe problem of getting out the gold.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"How are we going to get at it?\" asked Tom, as he looked\\n\\nat the high sides of the sunken ship, which towered well\\n\\nabove the comparatively small Advance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why, just go in and get it,\" suggested Mr. Damon. \"Where\\n\\nis gold in a cargo usually kept, Captain Weston? You ought\\n\\nto know, I should think. Bless my pocketbook!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I should say that in this case the bullion would be\\n\\nkept in a safe in the captain\\'s cabin,\" replied the sailor.\\n\\n\"Or, if not there, in some after part of the vessel, away\\n\\nfrom where the crew is quartered. But it is going to be\\n\\nquite a problem to get at it. We can\\'t climb the sides of\\n\\nthe wreck, and it will be impossible to lower her ladder\\n\\nover the side. However, I think we had better get into the\\n\\ndiving suits and take a closer look. We can walk around\\n\\nher.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s my idea,\" put in Mr. Sharp. \"But who will go, and\\n\\nwho will stay with the ship?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I think Tom and Captain Weston had better go, suggested\\n\\nMr. Swift. \"Then, in case anything happens, Mr. Sharp, you\\n\\nand I will be on board to manage matters.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You don\\'t think anything will happen, do you, dad?\" asked\\n\\nhis son with a laugh, but it was not an easy one, for the\\n\\nlad was thinking of the shadowy forms of the ugly sharks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, no, but it\\'s best to be prepared,\" answered his\\n\\nfather.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe captain and the young inventor lost no time in donning\\n\\nthe diving suits. They each took a heavy metal bar, pointed\\n\\nat one end, to use in assisting them to walk on the bed of\\n\\nthe ocean, and as a protection in case the sharks might\\n\\nattack them. Entering the diving chamber, they were shut in,\\n\\nand then water was admitted until the pressure was seen, by\\n\\ngages, to be the same as that outside the submarine. Then\\n\\nthe sliding steel door was opened. At first Tom and the\\n\\ncaptain could barely move, so great was the pressure of\\n\\nwater on their bodies. They would have been crushed but for\\n\\nthe protection afforded by the strong diving suits.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a few minutes they became used to it, and stepped out\\n\\non the floor of the ocean. They could not, of course, speak\\n\\nto each other, but Tom looked through the glass eyes of his\\n\\nhelmet at the captain, and the latter motioned for the lad\\n\\nto follow. The two divers could breathe perfectly, and by\\n\\nmeans of small, but powerful lights on the helmets, the way\\n\\nwas lighted for them as they advanced.\\n\\n\\n\\nSlowly they approached the wreck, and began a circuit of\\n\\nher. They could see several places where the pressure of the\\n\\nwater, and the strain of the storm in which she had\\n\\nfoundered, had \\'opened the plates of the ship, but in no\\n\\ncase were the openings large enough to admit a person.\\n\\nCaptain Weston put his steel bar in one crack, and tried to\\n\\npry it farther open, but his strength was not equal to the\\n\\ntask. He made some peculiar motions, but Tom could not\\n\\nunderstand them.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey looked for some means by which they could mount to\\n\\nthe decks of the Boldero, but none was visible. It was like\\n\\ntrying to scale a fifty-foot smooth steel wall. There was no\\n\\nplace for a foothold. Again the sailor made some peculiar\\n\\nmotions, and the lad puzzled over them. They had gone nearly\\n\\naround the wreck now, and as yet had seen no way in which to\\n\\nget at the gold. As they passed around the bow, which was in\\n\\na deep shadow from a great rock, they caught sight of the\\n\\nsubmarine lying a short distance away. Light streamed from\\n\\nmany hull\\'s-eyes, and Tom felt a sense of security as he\\n\\nlooked at her, for it was lonesome enough in that great\\n\\ndepth of water, unable to speak to his companion, who was a\\n\\nfew feet in advance.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly there was a swirling of the water, and Tom was\\n\\nnearly thrown off his feet by the rush of some great body. A\\n\\nlong, black shadow passed over his head, and an instant\\n\\nlater he saw the form of a great shark launched at Captain\\n\\nWeston. The lad involuntarily cried in alarm, but the result\\n\\nwas surprising. He was nearly deafened by his own voice,\\n\\nconfined as the sound was in the helmet he wore. But the\\n\\nsailor, too, had felt the movement of the water, and turned\\n\\njust in time. He thrust upward with his pointed bar. But he\\n\\nmissed the stroke, and Tom, a moment later, saw the great\\n\\nfish turn over so that its mouth, which is far underneath\\n\\nits snout, could take in the queer shape which the shark\\n\\nevidently thought was a choice morsel. The big fish did\\n\\nactually get the helmet of Captain Weston inside its jaws,\\n\\nbut probably it would have found it impossible to crush the\\n\\nstrong steel. Still it might have sprung the joints, and\\n\\nwater would have entered, which would have been as fatal as\\n\\nthough the sailor had been swallowed by the shark. Tom\\n\\nrealized this and, moving as fast as he could through the\\n\\nwater, he came up behind the monster and drove his steel bar\\n\\ndeep into it.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sea was crimsoned with blood, and the savage creature,\\n\\nopening its mouth, let go of the captain. It turned on Tom,\\n\\nwho again harpooned it. Then the fish darted off and began a\\n\\nwild flurry, for it was dying. The rush of water nearly\\n\\nthrew Tom off his feet, but he managed to make his way over\\n\\nto his friend, and assist him to rise. A confident look from\\n\\nthe sailor showed the lad that Captain Weston was uninjured,\\n\\nthough he must have been frightened. As the two turned to\\n\\nmake their way back to the submarine, the waters about them\\n\\nseemed alive with the horrible monsters.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt needed but a glance to show what they were, Sharks!\\n\\nScores of them, long, black ones, with their ugly, undershot\\n\\nmouths. They had been attracted by the blood of the one Tom\\n\\nhad killed, but there was not a meal for all of them off the\\n\\ndying creature, and the great fish might turn on the young\\n\\ninventor and his companion.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe two shrank closer toward the wreck. They might get\\n\\nunder the prow of that and be safe. But even as they started\\n\\nto move, several of the sea wolves darted quickly at them.\\n\\nTom glanced at the captain. What could they do? Strong as\\n\\nwere the diving suits, a combined attack by the sharks, with\\n\\ntheir powerful jaws, would do untold damage.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt that moment there seemed some movement on board the\\n\\nsubmarine. Tom could see his father looking from the conning\\n\\ntower, and the aged inventor seemed to be making some\\n\\nmotions. Then Tom understood. Mr. Swift was directing his\\n\\nson and Captain Weston to crouch down. The lad did so,\\n\\npulling the sailor after him. Then Tom saw the bow electric\\n\\ngun run out, and aimed at the mass of sharks, most of whom\\n\\nwere congregated about the dead one. Into the midst of the\\n\\nmonsters was fired a number of small projectiles, which\\n\\ncould be used in the electric cannon in place of the solid\\n\\nshot. Once more the waters were red with blood, and those\\n\\nsharks which were not killed swirled off. Tom and Captain\\n\\nWeston were saved. They were soon inside the submarine\\n\\nagain. telling their thrilling story.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s lucky you saw us, dad,\" remarked the lad, blushing\\n\\nat the praise Mr. Damon bestowed on him for killing the\\n\\nmonster which had attacked the captain.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, I was on the lookout,\" said the inventor. \"But what\\n\\nabout getting into the wreck?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I think the only way we can do it will be to ram a hole\\n\\nin her side,\" said Captain Weston. \"That was what I tried to\\n\\ntell Tom by motions, but he didn\\'t seem to understand me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No,\" replied the lad, who was still a little nervous from\\n\\nhis recent experience. \"I thought you meant for us to turn\\n\\nit over, bottom side up,\" and he laughed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my gizzard!  Just like a shark,\" commented Mr.\\n\\nDamon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Please don\\'t mention them,\" begged Tom. \"I hope we don\\'t\\n\\nsee any more of them.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, I fancy they have been driven far enough away from\\n\\nthis neighborhood now,\" commented the captain. \"But now\\n\\nabout the wreck. We may be able to approach it from above.\\n\\nSuppose we try to lower the submarine on it? That will save\\n\\nripping it open.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThis was tried a little later, but would not work. There\\n\\nwere strong currents sweeping over the top of the Boldero,\\n\\ncaused by a submerged reef near which she had settled. It\\n\\nwas a delicate task to sink the submarine on her decks, and\\n\\nwith the deep waters swirling about was found to be\\n\\nimpossible, even with the use of the electric plates and the\\n\\nauxiliary screws. Once more the Advance settled to the ocean\\n\\nbed, near the wreck.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, what\\'s to be done?\" asked Tom, as he looked at the\\n\\nhigh steel sides.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ram her, tear a hole, and then use dynamite,\" decided\\n\\nCaptain Weston promptly. \"You have some explosive, haven\\'t\\n\\nyou, Mr. Swift?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, yes. I came prepared for emergencies.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then we\\'ll blow up the wreck and get at the gold.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Twenty-Four\\n\\n\\n\\nRamming the Wreck\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFitted with a long, sharp steel ram in front, the Advance\\n\\nwas peculiarly adapted for this sort of work. In designing\\n\\nthe ship this ram was calculated to be used against hostile\\n\\nvessels in war time, for the submarine was at first, as we\\n\\nknow, destined for a Government boat. Now the ram was to\\n\\nserve a good turn.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo make sure that the attempt would be a success, the\\n\\nmachinery of the craft was carefully gone over. It was found\\n\\nto be in perfect order, save for a few adjustments which\\n\\nwere needed. Then, as it was night, though there was no\\n\\ndifference in the appearance of things below the surface, it\\n\\nwas decided to turn in, and begin work in the morning. Nor\\n\\ndid the gold-seekers go to the surface, for they feared they\\n\\nmight encounter a storm.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We had trouble enough locating the wreck, said Captain\\n\\nWeston, \"and if we go up we may be blown off our course. We\\n\\nhave air enough to stay below, haven\\'t we, Tom?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Plenty,\" answered the lad, looking at the gages.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter a hearty breakfast the next morning, the submarine\\n\\ncrew got ready for their hard task. The craft was backed\\n\\naway as far as was practical, and then, running at full\\n\\nspeed, she rammed the wreck. The shock was terrific, and at\\n\\nfirst it was feared some damage had been done to the\\n\\nAdvance, but she stood the strain.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Did we open up much of a hole?\" anxiously asked Mr.\\n\\nSwift.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Pretty good,\" replied Tom, observing it through the\\n\\nconning tower bull\\'s-eyes, when the submarine had backed off\\n\\nagain. \"Let\\'s give her another.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce more the great steel ram hit into the side of the\\n\\nBoldero, and again the submarine shivered from the shock.\\n\\nBut there was a bigger hole in the wreck now, and after\\n\\nCaptain Weston had viewed it he decided it was large enough\\n\\nto allow a person to enter and place a charge of dynamite so\\n\\nthat the treasure ship would be broken up.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom and the captain placed the explosive. Then the Advance\\n\\nwas withdrawn to a safe distance. There was a dull rumble, a\\n\\ngreat swirling of the water, which was made murky; but when\\n\\nit cleared, and the submarine went back, it was seen that\\n\\nthe wreck was effectively broken up. It was in two parts,\\n\\neach one easy of access.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s the stuff!\" cried Tom. \"Now to get at the gold!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, get out the diving suits,\" added Mr. Damon. \"Bless\\n\\nmy watch-charm, I think I\\'ll chance it in one myself! Do you\\n\\nthink the sharks are all gone, Captain Weston?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I think so.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a short time Tom, the captain, Mr. Sharp and Mr. Damon\\n\\nwere attired in the diving suits, Mr. Swift not caring to\\n\\nventure into such a great depth of water. Besides, it was\\n\\nnecessary for at least one person to remain in the submarine\\n\\nto operate the diving chamber.\\n\\n\\n\\nWalking slowly along the bottom of the sea the four gold-\\n\\nseekers approached the wreck. They looked on all sides for a\\n\\nsight of the sharks, but the monster fish seemed to have\\n\\ndeserted that part of the ocean. Tom was the first to reach\\n\\nthe now disrupted steamer. He found he could easily climb\\n\\nup, for boxes and barrels from the cargo holds were\\n\\nscattered all about by the explosion. Captain Weston soon\\n\\njoined the lad. The sailor motioned Tom to follow him, and\\n\\nbeing more familiar with ocean craft the captain was\\n\\npermitted to take the lead. He headed aft, seeking to locate\\n\\nthe captain\\'s cabin. Nor was he long in finding it. He\\n\\nmotioned for the others to enter, that the combined\\n\\nillumination of the lamps in their helmets would make the\\n\\nplace bright enough so a search could be made for the gold.\\n\\nTom suddenly seized the arm of the captain, and pointed to\\n\\none corner of the cabin. There stood a small safe, and at\\n\\nthe sight of it Captain Weston moved toward it. The door was\\n\\nnot locked, probably having been left open when the ship was\\n\\ndeserted. Swinging it back the interior was revealed.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was empty. There was no gold bullion in it.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was no mistaking the dejected air of Captain Weston.\\n\\nThe others shared his feelings, but though they all felt\\n\\nlike voicing their disappointment, not a word could be\\n\\nspoken. Mr. Sharp, by vigorous motions, indicated to his\\n\\ncompanions to seek further.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey did so, spending all the rest of the day in the\\n\\nwreck, save for a short interval for dinner. But no gold\\n\\nrewarded their search.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom, late that afternoon, wandered away from the others,\\n\\nand found himself in the captain\\'s cabin again, with the\\n\\nempty safe showing dimly in the water that was all about.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hang it all!\" thought the lad, \"we\\'ve had all our trouble\\n\\nfor nothing! They must have taken the gold with them.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIdly he raised his steel bar, and struck it against the\\n\\npartition back of the safe. To his astonishment the\\n\\npartition seemed to fall inward, revealing a secret\\n\\ncompartment. The lad leaned forward to bring the light for\\n\\nhis helmet to play on the recess. He saw a number of boxes,\\n\\npiled one upon the other. He had accidentally touched a\\n\\nhidden spring and opened a secret receptacle. But what did\\n\\nit contain?\\n\\n\\n\\nTom reached in and tried to lift one of the boxes. He\\n\\nfound it beyond his strength. Trembling from excitement, he\\n\\nwent in search of the others. He found them delving in the\\n\\nafter part of the wreck, but by motions our hero caused them\\n\\nto follow him. Captain Weston showed the excitement he felt\\n\\nas soon as he caught sight of the boxes. He and Mr. Sharp\\n\\nlifted one out, and placed it on the cabin floor. They pried\\n\\noff the top with their bars.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere, packed in layers, were small yellow bars; dull,\\n\\ngleaming, yellow bars! It needed but a glance to show that\\n\\nthey were gold bullion. Tom had found the treasure. The lad\\n\\ntried to dance around there in the cabin of the wreck,\\n\\nnearly three miles below the surface of the ocean, but the\\n\\npressure of water was too much for him. Their trip had been\\n\\nsuccessful.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter Twenty-Five\\n\\n\\n\\nHome With the Gold\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was no time to be lost. They were in a treacherous\\n\\npart of the ocean, and strong currents might at any time\\n\\nfurther break up the wreck, so that they could not come at\\n\\nthe gold. It was decided, by means of motions, to at once\\n\\ntransfer the treasure to the submarine. As the boxes were\\n\\ntoo heavy to carry easily, especially as two men, who were\\n\\nrequired to lift one, could not walk together in the\\n\\nuncertain footing afforded by the wreck, another plan was\\n\\nadopted. The boxes were opened and the bars, a few at a\\n\\ntime, were dropped on a firm, sandy place at the side of the\\n\\nwreck. Tom and Captain Weston did this work, while Mr. Sharp\\n\\nand Mr. Damon carried the bullion to the diving chamber of\\n\\nthe Advance. They put the yellow bars inside, and when quite\\n\\na number had been thus shifted, Mr. Swift, closing the\\n\\nchamber, pumped the water out and removed the gold. Then he\\n\\nopened the chamber to the divers again, and the process was\\n\\nrepeated, until all the bullion had been secured.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom would have been glad to make a further examination of\\n\\nthe wreck, for he thought he could get some of the rifles\\n\\nthe ship carried, but Captain Weston signed to him not to\\n\\nattempt this.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe lad went to the pilot house, while his father and Mr.\\n\\nSharp took their places in the engine-room. The gold had\\n\\nbeen safely stowed in Mr. Swift\\'s cabin.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom took a last look at the wreck before he gave the\\n\\nstarting signal. As he gazed at the bent and twisted mass of\\n\\nsteel that had once been a great ship, he saw something\\n\\nlong, black and shadowy moving around from the other side,\\n\\ncoming across the bows.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There\\'s another big shark,\" he observed to Captain\\n\\nWeston. \"They\\'re coming back after us.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe captain did not speak. He was staring at the dark\\n\\nform. Suddenly, from what seemed the pointed nose of it,\\n\\nthere gleamed a light, as from some great eye.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Look at that!\" cried Tom. \"That\\'s no shark!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If you want my opinion,\" remarked the sailor, \"I should\\n\\nsay it was the other submarine--that of Berg and his\\n\\nfriends--the Wonder. They\\'ve managed to fix up their craft\\n\\nand are after the gold.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But they\\'re too late!\" cried Tom excitedly. \"Let\\'s tell\\n\\nthem so.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, advised the captain. \"We don\\'t want any trouble with\\n\\nthem.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Swift came forward to see why his son had not given\\n\\nthe signal to start. He was shown the other submarine, for\\n\\nnow that the Wonder had turned on several searchlights,\\n\\nthere was no doubt as to the identity of the craft.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Let\\'s get away unobserved if we can,\" he suggested. \"We\\n\\nhave had trouble enough.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was easy to do this, as the Advance was hidden behind\\n\\nthe wreck, and her lights were glowing but dimly. Then, too,\\n\\nthose in the other submarine were so excited over the\\n\\nfinding of what they supposed was the wreck containing the\\n\\ntreasure, that they paid little attention to anything else.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I wonder how they\\'ll feel when they find the gold gone?\"\\n\\nasked Tom as he pulled the lever starting the pumps.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, we may have a chance to learn, when we get back to\\n\\ncivilization,\" remarked the captain.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe surface was soon reached, and then, under fair skies,\\n\\nand on a calm sea, the voyage home was begun. Part of the\\n\\ntime the Advance sailed on the top, and part of the time\\n\\nsubmerged.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey met with but a single accident, and that was when the\\n\\nforward electrical plate broke. But with the aft one still\\n\\nin commission, and the auxiliary screws, they made good\\n\\ntime. Just before reaching home they settled down to the\\n\\nbottom and donned the diving suits again, even Mr. Swift\\n\\ntaking his turn. Mr. Damon caught some large lobsters, of\\n\\nwhich he was very fond, or, rather, to be more correct, the\\n\\nlobsters caught him. When he entered the diving chamber\\n\\nthere were four fine ones clinging to different parts of his\\n\\ndiving suit. Some of them were served for dinner.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe adventurers safely reached the New Jersey coast, and\\n\\nthe submarine was docked. Mr. Swift at once communicated\\n\\nwith the proper authorities concerning the recovery of the\\n\\ngold. He offered to divide with the actual owners, after he\\n\\nand his friends had been paid for their services, but as the\\n\\nrevolutionary party to whom the bullion was intended had\\n\\ngone out of existence, there was no one to officially claim\\n\\nthe treasure, so it all went to Tom and his friends, who\\n\\nmade an equitable distribution of it. The young inventor did\\n\\nnot forget to buy Mrs. Baggert a fine diamond ring, as he\\n\\nhad promised.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs for Berg and his employers, they were, it was learned\\n\\nlater, greatly chagrined at finding the wreck valueless.\\n\\nThey tried to make trouble for Tom and his father, but were\\n\\nnot successful.\\n\\n\\n\\nA few days after arriving at the seacoast cottage, Tom,\\n\\nhis father and Mr. Damon went to Shopton in the airship.\\n\\nCaptain Weston, Garret Jackson and Mn Sharp remained behind\\n\\nin charge of the submarine. It was decided that the Swifts\\n\\nwould keep the craft and not sell it to the Government, as\\n\\nTom said they might want to go after more treasure some day.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I must first deposit this gold,\" said Mr. Swift as the\\n\\nairship landed in front of the shed at his home. \"It won\\'t\\n\\ndo to keep it in the house over night, even if the Happy\\n\\nHarry gang is in jail.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom helped him take it to the bank. As they were making\\n\\nperhaps the largest single deposit ever put in the\\n\\ninstitution, Ned Newton came out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, Tom,\" he cried to his chum, \"it seems that you are\\n\\nnever going to stop doing things. You\\'ve conquered the air,\\n\\nthe earth and the water.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What have you been doing while I\\'ve been under water,\\n\\nNed?\" asked the young inventor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, the same old thing. Running errands and doing all\\n\\nsorts of work in the bank.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom had a sudden idea. He whispered to his father and Mr.\\n\\nSwift nodded. A little later he was closeted with Mr.\\n\\nPrendergast, the bank president. It was not long before Ned\\n\\nand Tom were called in.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I have some good news for you, Ned,\" said Mr.\\n\\nPrendergast, while Tom smiled. \"Mr. Swift er--ahem--one of\\n\\nour largest depositors, has spoken to me about you, Ned. I\\n\\nfind that you have been very faithful. You are hereby\\n\\nappointed assistant cashier, and of course you will get a\\n\\nmuch larger salary.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nNed could hardly believe it, but he knew then what Tom had\\n\\nwhispered to Mr. Swift. The wishes of a depositor who brings\\n\\nmuch gold bullion to a bank can hardly be ignored.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Come on out and have some soda,\" invited Tom, and when\\n\\nNed looked inquiringly at the president, the latter nodded\\n\\nan assent.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the two lads were crossing the street to a drug store,\\n\\nsomething whizzed past them, nearly running them down.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What sort of an auto was that?\" cried Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That? Oh, that was Andy Foger\\'s new car,\" answered Ned.\\n\\n\"He\\'s been breaking the speed laws every day lately, but no\\n\\none seems to bother him. It\\'s because his father is rich, I\\n\\nsuppose. Andy says he has the fastest car ever built.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He has, eh?\" remarked Tom, while a curious look came into\\n\\nhis eyes. \"Well, maybe I can build one that will beat his.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd whether the young inventor did or not you can learn by\\n\\nreading the fifth volume of this series, to be called \"Tom\\n\\nSwift and His Electric Runabout; Or, The Speediest Car on\\n\\nthe Road.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, Tom, I certainly appreciate what you did for me in\\n\\ngetting me a better position,\" remarked Ned as they left the\\n\\ndrug store. \"I was beginning to think I\\'d never get\\n\\npromoted. Say, have you anything to do this evening? If you\\n\\nhaven\\'t, I wish you\\'d come over to my house. I\\'ve got a lot\\n\\nof pictures I took while you were away.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Sorry, but I can\\'t,\" replied Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why, are you going to build another airship or submarine?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, but I\\'m going to see-- Oh, what do you want to know\\n\\nfor, anyhow?\" demanded the young inventor with a blush.\\n\\n\"Can\\'t a fellow go see a girl without being cross-questioned?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, of course,\" replied Ned with a laugh. \"Give Miss\\n\\nNestor my regards,\" and at this Tom blushed still more. But,\\n\\nas he said, that was his own affair.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\\'s Etext of Tom Swift And His Submarine Boat\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProject Gutenberg\\'s Etext of Tom Swift And His Electric Runabout\\n\\n#5 in the Victor Appleton\\'s Tom Swift Series\\n\\nWe name the Tom Swift files as they are numbered in the books--\\n\\ni.e. This is #5 in the series so the file name is 05tomxxx.xxx,\\n\\nwhere the x\\'s are place holders for editon # and file type such\\n\\nas 05tom10.txt and 05tom10.zip, when we do a .htm, 05tom10h.htm\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCopyright laws are changing all over the world, be sure to check\\n\\nthe copyright laws for your country before posting these files!!\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease take a look at the important information in this header.\\n\\nWe encourage you to keep this file on your own disk, keeping an\\n\\nelectronic path open for the next readers.

No, it\\'s another prize I\\'m\\n\\nthinking about.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I see by this paper that the Touring Club of America has\\n\\noffered three thousand dollars for the speediest electric car.\\n\\nThe tests are to come off this fall, on a new and specially built\\n\\ntrack on Long Island, and it\\'s to be an endurance contest for\\n\\ntwenty-four hours, or a race for distance, they haven\\'t yet\\n\\ndecided. But I\\'m going to have a try for it, dad, and, besides\\n\\nwinning the prize, I think I\\'ll take Andy Foger down a peg.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s Andy been doing now?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, nothing more than usual. He\\'s always mean, and looking\\n\\nfor a chance to make trouble for me, but I didn\\'t refer to\\n\\nanything special He has a new auto, you know, and he boasts that\\n\\nit\\'s the fastest one in this country. I\\'ll show him that it\\n\\nisn\\'t, for I\\'m going to win this prize with the speediest car on\\n\\nthe road.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But, Tom, you haven\\'t any automobile, you know,\" and Mr. Swift\\n\\nlooked anxiously at his son, who was smiling confidently. \"You\\n\\ncan\\'t be going to make your motor-cycle into an auto; are you?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, dad.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then how are you going to take part in the prize contest?\\n\\nBesides, electric cars, as far as I know, aren\\'t specially\\n\\nspeedy.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I know it, and one reason why this club has arranged the\\n\\ncontest is to improve the quality of electric automobiles. I\\'m\\n\\ngoing to build an electric runabout, dad.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"An electric runabout?  But it will have to be operated with a\\n\\nstorage battery, Tom, and you haven\\'t--\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I guess you\\'re going to say I haven\\'t any storage battery,\\n\\ndad,\" interrupted Mr. Swift\\'s son. \"Well, I haven\\'t yet, but I\\'m\\n\\ngoing to have one. I\\'ve been working on--\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, ho!\" exclaimed the aged inventor with a laugh. \"So that\\'s\\n\\nwhat you\\'ve been tinkering over these last few weeks, eh, Tom?  I\\n\\nsuspected it was some new invention, but I didn\\'t suppose it was\\n\\nthat. Well, how are you coming on with it?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Pretty good, I think. I\\'ve got a new idea for a battery, and I\\n\\nmade an experimental one. I gave it some pretty severe tests, and\\n\\nit worked fine.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But you haven\\'t tried it out in a car yet, over rough roads,\\n\\nand under severe conditions have you?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, I haven\\'t had a chance. In fact, when I invented the\\n\\nbattery I had no idea of using it on a car I thought it might\\n\\nanswer for commercial purposes, or for storing a current\\n\\ngenerated by windmills. But when I read that account in the\\n\\npapers of the Touring Club, offering a prize for the best\\n\\nelectric car, it occurred to me that I might put my battery into\\n\\nan auto, and win.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hum,\" remarked Mr. Swift musingly. \"I don\\'t take much stock in\\n\\nelectric autos, Tom. Gasolene seems to be the best, or perhaps\\n\\nsteam, generated by gasolene. I\\'m afraid you\\'ll be disappointed.\\n\\nAll the electric runabouts I ever saw, while they were very nice\\n\\ncars, didn\\'t seem able to go so very fast, or very far.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s true, but it\\'s because they didn\\'t have the right kind\\n\\nof a battery. You know an electric locomotive can make pretty\\n\\ngood speed, Dad. Over a hundred miles an hour in tests.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, but they don\\'t run by storage batteries. They have a\\n\\nthird rail, and powerful motors,\" and Mr. Swift looked\\n\\nquizzically at his son. He loved to argue with him, for he said\\n\\nit made Tom think, and often the two would thus thresh out some\\n\\nknotty point of an invention, to the interests of both.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Of course, Dad, there is a good deal of theory in what I\\'m\\n\\nthinking of,\" the lad admitted. \"But it does seem to me that if\\n\\nyou put the right kind of a battery into an automobile, it could\\n\\nscoot along pretty lively. Look what speed a trolley car can\\n\\nmake.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, Tom, but there again they get their power from an\\n\\noverhead wire.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Some of them don\\'t. There\\'s a new storage battery been\\n\\ninvented by a New Jersey man, which does as well as the third\\n\\nrail or the overhead wire. It was after reading about his battery\\n\\nthat I thought of a plan for mine. It isn\\'t anything like his;\\n\\nperhaps not as good in some ways, but, for what I want, it is\\n\\nbetter in some respects, I think. For one thing it can be\\n\\nrecharged very quickly.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Now Tom, look here,\" said Mr. Swift earnestly, laying aside\\n\\nhis papers, and coming over to where his son sat. \"You know I\\n\\nnever interfere with your inventions. In fact, the more you think\\n\\nof the better I like it. The airship you helped build certainly\\n\\ndid all that could be desired, and--\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That reminds me. Mr. Sharp and Mr. Damon are out in it now,\"\\n\\ninterrupted Tom. \"They ought to be back soon. Yes, Dad, the\\n\\nairship Red Cloud certainly scooted along.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And the submarine, too,\" continued the aged inventor. \"Your\\n\\nideas regarding that were of service to me, and helped in our\\n\\ntask of recovering the treasure, but I\\'m afraid you\\'re going to\\n\\nbe disappointed in the storage battery. You may get it to work,\\n\\nbut I don\\'t believe you can make it powerful enough to attain any\\n\\ngreat speed. Why don\\'t you confine yourself to making a battery\\n\\nfor stationary work?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Because, Dad, I believe I can build a speedy car, and I\\'m\\n\\ngoing to try it. Besides I want to race Andy Foger, and beat him,\\n\\neven if I don\\'t win the prize. I\\'m going to build that car, and\\n\\nit will make fast time.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, go ahead, Tom,\" responded his father, after a pause. \"Of\\n\\ncourse you can use the shops here as much as you want, and Mr.\\n\\nSharp, Mr. Jackson, and I will help you all we can. Only don\\'t be\\n\\ndisappointed, that\\'s all.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I won\\'t, Dad. Suppose you come out to my shop and I\\'ll show\\n\\nyou a sample battery I\\'ve been testing for the last week. I have\\n\\nit geared to a small motor, and it\\'s been running steadily for\\n\\nsome time. I want to see what sort of a record it\\'s made.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFather and son crossed the yard, and entered a shop which the\\n\\nlad considered exclusively his own. There he had made many\\n\\nmachines, and pieces of apparatus, and had invented a number of\\n\\narticles which had been patented, and yielded him considerable of\\n\\nan income.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There\\'s the battery, Dad,\" he said, pointing to a complicated\\n\\nmechanism in one corner\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s that buzzing noise?\" asked Mr. Swift. \"That\\'s the\\n\\nlittle motor I run from the new cells. Look here,\" and Tom\\n\\nswitched on an electric light above the experimental battery,\\n\\nfrom which he hoped so much. It consisted of a steel can, about\\n\\nthe size of the square gallon tin in which maple syrup comes, and\\n\\nfrom it ran two wires which were attached to a small motor that\\n\\nwas industriously whirring away.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom looked at a registering gauge connected with it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s pretty good,\" remarked the young inventor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What is it, Tom?\" and his father peered about the shop.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why this motor has run an equivalent of two hundred miles on\\n\\none charging of the battery! That\\'s much better than I expected.\\n\\nI thought if I got a hundred out of it I\\'d be doing well. Dad, I\\n\\nbelieve, after I improve my battery a bit, that I\\'ll have the\\n\\nvery thing I want!  I\\'ll install a set of them in a car, and it\\n\\nwill go like the wind. I\\'ll --\" Tom\\'s enthusiastic remarks were\\n\\nsuddenly interrupted by a low, rumbling sound.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thunder!\" exclaimed Mr. Swift. \"The storm is coming, and Mr.\\n\\nSharp and Mr. Damon in the airship--\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHardly had he spoken than there sounded a crash on the roof of\\n\\nthe Swift house, not far away. At the same time there came cries\\n\\nof distress, and the crash was repeated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Come on, Dad!  Something has happened!\" yelled Tom, dashing\\n\\nfrom the shop, followed by his parent. They found themselves in\\n\\nthe midst of a rain storm, as they raced toward the house, on the\\n\\nroof of which the smashing noise was again heard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II              MR. DAMON\\'S STEERING\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTom Swift was a lad of action, and his quickness in hurrying\\n\\nout to investigate what had happened when he was explaining about\\n\\nhis new battery, was characteristic of him. Those of my readers\\n\\nwho know him, through having read the previous books of this\\n\\nseries, need not be told this, but you who, perhaps, are just\\n\\nmaking his acquaintance, may care to know a little more about\\n\\nhim.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs told in my first book, \"Tom Swift and His Motor-Cycle\" the\\n\\nyoung inventor lived with his father, Barton Swift, a widower, in\\n\\nthe town of Shopton, New York. Mr. Swift was also an inventor of\\n\\nnote.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn my initial volume of this series, Tom became possessed of a\\n\\nmotor-cycle in a peculiar way. It was sold to him by a Mr.\\n\\nWakefield Damon, a wealthy gentleman who was unfortunate in\\n\\nriding it. On his speedy machine, which Tom improved by several\\n\\ninventions, he had a number of adventures. The principal one was\\n\\nbeing attacked by a number of bad men, known as the \"Happy Harry\\n\\nGang,\" who wished to obtain possession of a valuable turbine\\n\\npatent model belonging to Mr. Swift. Tom was taking it to a\\n\\nlawyer, when he was waylaid, and chloroformed. Later he traced\\n\\nthe gang, and, with the assistance of Mr. Damon and Eradicate\\n\\nSampson, an aged colored man who made a living for himself and\\n\\nhis mule, Boomerang, by doing odd jobs, the lad found the thieves\\n\\nand recovered a motor-boat which had been stolen. But the men got\\n\\naway.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the second volume, called \"Tom Swift and His Motor-Boat,\"\\n\\nTom bought at auction the boat stolen by, and recovered from, the\\n\\nthieves, and proceeded to improve it. While he was taking his\\n\\nfather out on a cruise for Mr Swift\\'s health, the Happy Harry\\n\\nGang made a successful attempt to steal some valuable inventions\\n\\nfrom the Swift house. Tom started to trace them, and incidentally\\n\\nhe raced and beat Andy Foger, a rich bully. On their way down the\\n\\nlake, after the robbery, Tom, his father and Ned Newton, Tom\\'s\\n\\nchum, saw a man hanging from the trapeze of a blazing balloon\\n\\nover Lake Carlopa. The balloonist was Mr. John Sharp and he was\\n\\nrescued by Tom in a thrilling fashion. In his motor-boat, Tom had\\n\\nmuch pleasure, not the least of which was taking out a young lady\\n\\nnamed Miss Mary Nestor, whose acquaintance he had made after\\n\\nstopping her runaway horse, which his bicycle had frightened.\\n\\nTom\\'s association with  Miss Nestor soon ripened into something\\n\\ndeeper than mere friendship.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt developed that Mr Sharp, whom Tom had saved from the burning\\n\\nballoon, was an aeronaut of note, and had once planned to build\\n\\nan airship. After his recovery from his thrilling experience, he\\n\\nmentioned the matter to Mr. Swift and his son, with whom he took\\n\\nup his residence. This fitted right in with Tom\\'s ideas, and soon\\n\\nfather, son and the balloonist were constructing the Red Cloud,\\n\\nas they named their airship. It was finally completed, as related\\n\\nin \"Tom Swift and His Airship,\" made a successful trial trip, and\\n\\nwon a prize. It was planned to make a longer journey, and Tom,\\n\\nMr. Sharp and Mr. Damon agreed to go together. Mr. Damon was an\\n\\nodd individual, who was continuously blessing some part of his\\n\\nanatomy, his clothing or some inanimate object but, for all that,\\n\\nhe was a fine man.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe night before Tom and his friends started off in their\\n\\nairship, the Shopton Bank vault was blown open and seventy-five\\n\\nthousand dollars was taken. Tom and his friends did not know of\\n\\nthis, but, no sooner had the young inventor, Mr. Sharp and Mr.\\n\\nDamon sailed away, than the police arrived at Mr. Swift\\'s house\\n\\nto arrest them. They were charged with the robbery, and with\\n\\nhaving sailed away with the booty.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt appeared that Andy Foger said he had seen Tom hanging around\\n\\nthe bank the night of the robbery, with a bag of burglar tools in\\n\\nhis possession. Search was immediately begun for the airship, the\\n\\noccupants of which were, meanwhile, speeding on.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom and his two friends had trouble. They were nearly burned up\\n\\nin a forest fire, and were fired upon by a crowd of people with\\n\\nrifles, who, reading of the bank robbery and the reward offered\\n\\nfor the capture of the thieves, hoped to bring down the airship.\\n\\nThe fact that they were fired upon caused Tom and the two\\n\\naeronauts to descend to make an investigation, and for the first\\n\\ntime they learned of the bank theft. How they got track of the\\n\\nreal robbers, took the sheriff with them in the airship, and\\n\\nraided the gang will be found set down at length in the book.\\n\\nAlso how Tom administered well-deserved thrashing to Andy Foger.\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Swift did not accompany his son in the airship, and when\\n\\nasked why he did not care to make the trip, said he was working\\n\\non a new type of submarine boat, which he hoped to enter in the\\n\\ngovernment trials, to win a prize. In the fourth volume of the\\n\\nseries, called \"Tom Swift and his Submarine,\" you may read how\\n\\nsuccessful Mr. Swift was.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the submarine, called the Advance, was finished, the party\\n\\nmade a trip to recover three hundred thousand dollars in gold\\n\\nfrom a sunken treasure ship, off the coast of Uruguay, South\\n\\nAmerica. They sailed beneath the seas for many miles, and were in\\n\\ngreat peril at times. One reason for this was that a rival firm\\n\\nof submarine builders got wind of the treasure, and tried to get\\n\\nahead of the Swifts in recovering it. How Tom and his friends\\n\\nsucceeded in their quest, how they nearly perished at the bottom\\n\\nof the sea, how they were captured by a foreign war vessel, and\\n\\nsentenced to death, how they fought with a school of giant sharks\\n\\nand how they blew up the wreck to recover the money is all told\\n\\nof in the book.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn their return to civilization with the gold, Mr. Swift, Tom,\\n\\nand their friends deposited the money in the Shopton Bank, where\\n\\nNed Newton worked. Ned was a bright lad, but had not been\\n\\nadvanced as rapidly as he deserved, and Tom knew this. He asked\\n\\nhis father to speak to the president, Mr. Pendergast, in Ned\\'s\\n\\nbehalf, and, as a result the lad was made assistant cashier, for\\n\\nthe request of a man who controlled a three hundred thousand\\n\\ndollar deposit was not to be despised.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn building the submarine Tom and his father rented a large\\n\\ncottage on the New Jersey seacoast, but, on returning from their\\n\\ntreasure-quest they went back to Shopton, leaving the submarine\\n\\nat the boathouse of the shore cottage, which was near the city of\\n\\nAtlantis. That was in the fall of the year, and all that winter\\n\\nthe young inventor had been busy on many things, not the least of\\n\\nwhich was his storage battery. It was now spring, and seeing the\\n\\nitem in the paper, about the touring club prize for an electric\\n\\nauto, had given him a new idea.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut all thoughts of electric cars, and everything else, were\\n\\ndriven from the mind of the young man, when, with his father, he\\n\\nrushed out to see the cause of the crash on the roof of the Swift\\n\\nhomestead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There\\'s something up there, Tom,\" called his father, as he\\n\\nsplashed on through the rain.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s right,\" added his son. \"And somebody, too, to judge by\\n\\nthe fuss they\\'re making.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Maybe the house has been struck by lightning!\" suggested the\\n\\naged inventor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, the storm isn\\'t severe enough for that; and, besides, if\\n\\nthe house had been struck you\\'d hear Mrs. Baggert yelling, Dad.\\n\\nShe--\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAt that moment a woman\\'s voice cried out:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Mr. Swift! Tom! Where are you? Something dreadful has\\n\\nhappened!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There she goes!\" remarked Mr. Swift, as he splashed into a mud\\n\\npuddle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my deflection rudder!\" suddenly cried a voice from the\\n\\nflat roof of the Swift house. \"Hello! I say, is anyone down\\n\\nthere?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, we are,\" answered Tom. \"Is that you, Mr. Damon?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my collar button! It certainly is.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Where\\'s Mr. Sharp? I don\\'t hear him.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'m here all right,\" answered the balloonist. \"I\\'m trying\\n\\nto get the airship clear of the chimney. Mr. Damon--\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, I steered wrong!\" interrupted the odd man. \"Bless my\\n\\nliver pin, but it was so dark I couldn\\'t see, and when that clap\\n\\nof thunder came I shifted the deflection rudder instead of the\\n\\nlateral one, and tried to knock over your chimney.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Are either of you hurt?\" asked Mr. Swift anxiously.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, not at all,\" replied Mr. Sharp. \"We were moving slowly,\\n\\nready for a landing.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Is the airship damaged?\" inquired Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. Not much, I guess,\" was the answer of the\\n\\naeronaut. \"I\\'ve stopped the engine, and I don\\'t like to start it\\n\\nagain until I can see what shape we\\'re in.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll come up, with Mr. Jackson,\" called Tom, and he hastily\\n\\nsummoned Garret Jackson, an engineer, who had been in the service\\n\\nof Mr. Swift for many years. Together they proceeded to the roof\\n\\nby a stairway that led to a scuttle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Is anyone killed?\" asked Mrs. Baggert, as Tom hurried up the\\n\\nstairs. \"Don\\'t tell me there is, Tom!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t have to tell you, for no one is,\" replied the\\n\\nyoung inventor with a laugh. \"It\\'s all right. The airship tried\\n\\nto collide with the chimney, that\\'s all.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was soon on the large, flat roof of the dwelling, and, with\\n\\nthe aid of lanterns he, the engineer, and Mr. Sharp made a hasty\\n\\nexamination.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Anything wrong?\" inquired Mr. Damon, looking out from the\\n\\ncabin of the Red Cloud where he had taken refuge after the crash,\\n\\nand to get out of the wet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not much,\" answered Tom. \"One of the forward planes is\\n\\nsmashed, but we can rise by means of the gas, and float down. Is\\n\\nall clear, Mr. Sharp?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"All clear,\" replied the balloonist, for the airship had now\\n\\nbeen wheeled back from the entanglement with the chimney.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then here we go!\" cried Tom, as he and the aeronaut entered\\n\\nthe craft, while Mr. Jackson descended through the scuttle.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere came a fiercer burst to the storm, and, amid a series of\\n\\ndazzling lightning flashes and the muttering of thunder, the\\n\\nairship rose from the roof. Tom switched on the search-light,\\n\\nand, starting the big propellers, guided the craft skillfully\\n\\ntoward the big shed where it was housed when not in use.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith the grace of a bird it turned about in the air, and\\n\\nsettled to the ground. It was the work of but a few minutes to\\n\\nrun it into the shed. Then they all started for the house.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my umbrella!  How it rains!\" cried Mr. Damon, as he\\n\\nsplashed on through numerous puddles. \"We got back just in time,\\n\\nMr. Sharp.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Where did you go?\" asked the lad.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why we took a flight of about fifty miles and stopped at my\\n\\nhouse in Waterfield for supper. Were you anxious about us?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"A little when it began to storm,\" replied Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Anything new since we left?\" asked Mr. Sharp, for it was the\\n\\ncustom of himself, or some of his friends, to take little trips\\n\\nin the airship. They thought no more of it than many do of going\\n\\nfor a short spin in an automobile.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, there is something new,\" said Mr. Swift, as the party,\\n\\nall drenched now, reached the broad veranda.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my gaiters!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"What is it? I hope the\\n\\nHappy Harry gang hasn\\'t robbed you again; nor Berg and his men\\n\\ntried to take that treasure away from us, after we worked so hard\\n\\nto get it from the wreck.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, it isn\\'t that,\" replied Mr. Swift. \"The truth is that Tom\\n\\nthinks he has invented a storage battery that will revolutionize\\n\\nmatters. He\\'s going to build an electric automobile, he says.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I am,\" declared the lad, as the others looked at him, \"and it\\n\\nwill be the speediest one you ever saw, too!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III             THE MOTORCYCLE WINS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, Tom,\" remarked Mr. Sharp, after a pause following the\\n\\nlad\\'s announcement. \"I didn\\'t know you had any ambitions in that\\n\\nline. Tell us more about the battery. What system do you use;\\n\\nlead plates and sulphuric acid?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, that\\'s out of date long ago,\" declared the lad.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know much about electricity,\" admitted the\\n\\naeronaut. \"I\\'ll take my chances in an airship or a balloon, but\\n\\nwhen it comes to electricity I\\'m down and out.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So am I,\" admitted Mr. Damon. \"Bless my gizzard, it\\'s all I\\n\\ncan do to put a new spark plug in my automobile. Where is your\\n\\nnew battery, Tom?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Out in my shop, running yet if it hasn\\'t been frightened by\\n\\nthe airship smash,\" replied the lad, somewhat proudly. \"It\\'s an\\n\\noxide of nickel battery, with steel and oxide of iron negative\\n\\nelectrodes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What solution do you use, Tom?\" asked Mr. Swift. \"I didn\\'t get\\n\\nthat far in questioning you before the crash came,\" he added.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well I have, in the experimental battery, a solution of\\n\\npotassium hydrate,\" replied the lad, \"but I think I\\'m going to\\n\\nchange it, and add some lithium hydrate to it. I think that will\\n\\nmake it stronger.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my watch chain!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"It\\'s all Greek to\\n\\nme. Suppose you let us see it, Tom? I like to see wheels go\\n\\n\\'round, but I\\'m not much of a hand for chemical terms.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If you\\'re sure you\\'re not hurt by the airship smash, I will,\"\\n\\ndeclared the lad.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, we\\'re not hurt a bit,\" insisted Mr. Sharp. \"As I said we\\n\\nwere moving slow, for I knew it was about time to land. Mr. Damon\\n\\nwas steering--\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes I thought I\\'d try my hand at it, as it seemed so easy,\"\\n\\ninterrupted the eccentric man. \"But never again--not for mine! I\\n\\ncouldn\\'t see the house, and, before I knew it we were right over\\n\\nthe roof. Then the chimney seemed to stick itself up suddenly in\\n\\nfront of us, and--well, you know the rest. I\\'m willing to pay for\\n\\nany damage I caused.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, not at all!\" replied Tom. \"It\\'s easy enough to put on a\\n\\nnew plane, or, for that matter, we can operate the Red Cloud\\n\\nwithout it. But come on, I\\'ll show you my sample battery.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Here, take umbrellas!\" Mrs. Baggert called after them as they\\n\\nstarted toward the shop, for it was still raining.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We don\\'t mind getting wet,\" replied the young inventor. \"It\\'s\\n\\nin the interests of science.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Maybe it is. You don\\'t mind a wetting, but I mind you coming\\n\\nin and dripping water all over the carpets!\" retorted the\\n\\nhousekeeper.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my overshoes, I\\'m afraid we have wet the carpets a\\n\\ntrifle now,\" admitted Mr. Damon ruefully, as he looked down at a\\n\\npuddle, which had formed where he had been standing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s the reason I want you to take umbrellas this trip,\"\\n\\ninsisted Mrs. Baggert.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey complied, and were soon in the shop, where Tom explained\\n\\nhis battery. The small motor was still running and had, as the\\n\\nlad had said, gone the equivalent of over two hundred miles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If a small battery does as well as that, what will a larger\\n\\none do?\" asked Mr. Damon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Much better, I hope,\" replied the youth. \"But Dad doesn\\'t seem\\n\\nto have much faith in them.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" admitted Mr. Swift, \"I must say I am skeptical. Still,\\n\\nI acknowledge Tom has done some pretty good work along electrical\\n\\nlines. He helped me with the positive and negative plates on the\\n\\nsubmarine, and, maybe--well, we\\'ll wait and see,\" he concluded.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If you build a car I hope you give me a ride in it,\" said Mr.\\n\\nDamon. \"I\\'ve ridden fast in the air, and swiftly on top of, and\\n\\nunder, the water. Now I\\'d like to ride rapidly on top of the\\n\\nearth. The gasolene auto doesn\\'t go very fast.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll give you a ride that will make your hair stand up!\"\\n\\nprophesied Tom, and the time was to come when he would make good\\n\\nthat prediction.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe little party in the machine shop talked at some length\\n\\nabout Tom\\'s battery. He showed them how it was constructed, and\\n\\ngave them some of his ideas regarding the new type of auto he\\n\\nplanned to build.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" remarked Mr. Swift at length, \"if you want to keep your\\n\\nbrain fresh, Tom, you must get to bed earlier than this. It\\'s\\n\\nnearly twelve o\\'clock.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And I want to get up early !\" exclaimed the lad. \"I\\'m going to\\n\\nstart to build a larger battery to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And I\\'m going to repair the airship,\" added Mr. Sharp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my night cap, I promised my wife I\\'d be home early to-\\n\\nnight, too!\" suddenly exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"I don\\'t fancy making\\n\\nthe trip back to Waterfield in my auto, though. Something will be\\n\\nsure to happen. I\\'ll blow out a tire, or a spark plug will get\\n\\nsooty on me and--\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s raining harder than ever,\" interrupted Tom. \"Better stay\\n\\nhere to-night. You can telephone home.\"  Which Mr. Damon did.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom was up early the next morning, in spite of the fact that he\\n\\ndid not go to bed in good season, and before breakfast he was\\n\\nworking at his new storage battery. After the meal he hurried\\n\\nback to the shop, but it was not long before he came out,\\n\\nwheeling his motor-cycle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Where are you going, Tom?\" asked Mrs. Baggert.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'ve got to go to Mansburg to get some steel tubes for my\\n\\nnew battery,\" he replied. \"I thought I had some large enough, but\\n\\nI haven\\'t.\"  Mansburg was a good-sized town, near Shopton.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then I wish you\\'d bring me a bottle of stove polish,\"\\n\\nrequested the housekeeper. \"The liquid kind. I\\'m out of it, and\\n\\nthe stove is as red as a cow.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"All right,\" agreed the lad, as he leaped into the saddle and\\n\\npedaled off down the road. A moment later he had turned on the\\n\\npower, and was speeding along the highway, which was in good\\n\\ncondition on account of the shower of the night before.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom was thinking so deeply of his new invention, and planning\\n\\nwhat he would do when he had his electric runabout built, that,\\n\\nalmost before he knew it, he had reached Mansburg, purchased the\\n\\nsteel tubes, and the stove polish, and was on his way back again.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he was speeding along on a level road, he heard, coming\\n\\nbehind him, an automobile. The lad turned to one side, but, in\\n\\nspite of this the party in the car began a serenade of the\\n\\nelectric siren, and kept it up, making a wild discord.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter with those fellows!\" inquired Tom of\\n\\nhimself. \"Haven\\'t I given them enough of the road, or has their\\n\\nsteering gear broken?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe looked back over his shoulder, and it needed but a glance to\\n\\nshow that the car was all right, as regarded the steering\\n\\napparatus. And it needed only another glance to disclose the\\n\\nreason for the shrill sound of the siren.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Andy Foger!\" exclaimed Tom. \"I might have known. And Sam and\\n\\nPete are with him. Well, if he wants to make me get off the road,\\n\\nhe\\'ll find that I\\'ve got as much right as he has!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe kept on a straight course, wondering if the red-haired, and\\n\\nsquint-eyed bully would dare try to damage the motor-cycle.\\n\\n\\n\\nA little later Andy\\'s car was beside Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you get out of the way,\" demanded Sam, who could\\n\\nusually be depended on to aid Andy in all his mean tricks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Because I\\'m entitled to half the road,\" retorted our hero.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Humph! A slow-moving machine like yours hasn\\'t any right on\\n\\nthe road,\" sneered Andy, who had slowed down his car somewhat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t, eh?\" demanded Tom. \"Well, if you\\'ll get down out of\\n\\nthat car for a few minutes I\\'ll soon show you what my rights\\n\\nare!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nNow Andy, more than once, had come to personal encounters with\\n\\nTom, much to the anguish of the bully. He did not relish another\\n\\nchastisement, but his mean spirit could not brook interference.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you want a race?\" he inquired of Tom, in a sneering\\n\\ntone. \"I\\'ll give you a mile start, and beat you! I\\'ve got the\\n\\nfastest car built!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You have, eh?\" asked Tom, while a grim look came over his\\n\\nface. \"Maybe you\\'ll think differently some day.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Aw, he\\'s afraid to race; come on,\" suggested Pete. \"Don\\'t\\n\\nbother with him, Andy.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, I guess it wouldn\\'t be worth my while,\" was the reply of\\n\\nthe bully, and he threw the second gear into place, and began to\\n\\nmove away from the young inventor.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom was just as much pleased to be left alone, but he did not\\n\\nwant Andy Foger to think that he could have matters all his own\\n\\nway. Tom\\'s motor-cycle, since he had made some adjustments to it,\\n\\nwas very swift. In fact there were few autos that could beat it.\\n\\nHe had never tried it against Andy\\'s new car, and he was anxious\\n\\nto do so.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I wonder if I would stand any chance, racing him?\" thought the\\n\\nyoung inventor, as he saw the car slowly pulling away from him.\\n\\n\"I think I\\'ll wait until he gets some distance ahead, and then\\n\\nI\\'ll see how near I can come to him. If I get anywhere near him\\n\\nI\\'m pretty sure I can pass him. I\\'ll try it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Andy and his cronies looked back, Tom did not appear to be\\n\\ndoing anything save moving along at moderate speed on his\\n\\nmachine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You don\\'t dare race!\" Pete Bailey shouted to him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Wait,\" was what Tom whispered to himself.\\n\\n\\n\\nAndy\\'s car was now some distance ahead. The young inventor\\n\\nwaited a little longer, and then turned more power into his\\n\\nmachine. It leaped forward and began to \"eat up the road,\" as Tom\\n\\nexpressed it. He had seen Andy throw in the third gear, but knew\\n\\nthat there was a fourth speed on the bully\\'s car.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know whether I can beat him on that or not,\" thought\\n\\nthe lad dubiously. \"If I try, and fail, they\\'ll laugh at me. But\\n\\nI don\\'t think I\\'m going to fail.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFaster and faster he rode. He was rapidly overhauling Andy\\'s\\n\\ncar now, and, as they heard him approach, the three cronies\\n\\nturned around.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He\\'s going to race you, after all, Andy!\" cried Sam.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You mean he\\'s going to try,\" sneered Andy. \"I\\'ll give him all\\n\\nthe racing he wants!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIn another few seconds Tom was beside the auto, and would have\\n\\npassed it, only Andy opened his throttle a little more. For a\\n\\nmoment the auto jumped ahead, and then, as our hero turned on\\n\\nstill more power, he easily held his own.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Aw, you can never beat us!\" yelled Pete.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Of course not!\" added Sam.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll leave him behind in a second,\" prophesied Andy. \"Wait\\n\\nuntil I throw in the other gear,\" he added to his cronies in a\\n\\nlow voice. \"He thinks he\\'s going to beat me. I\\'ll let him think\\n\\nso, and then I\\'ll spurt ahead.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe two machines were now racing along side by side. Andy\\'s car\\n\\nwas going the limit on third gear, but he still had the fourth\\n\\ngear in reserve. Tom, too, still had a little margin of speed.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly Andy reached forward and yanked on a lever. There was\\n\\na grinding of cogs as the fourth gear slipped into place, for\\n\\nAndy did not handle his car skillfully. The effect, however, was\\n\\nat once apparent. The automobile shot forward.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Now where are you, Tom Swift?\" cried Sam.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom said nothing. He merely shifted a lever, and got a better\\n\\nspark. He also turned on a little more gasolene and opened the\\n\\nmuffler The quickness with which his motor-cycle shot forward\\n\\nalmost threw him from the saddle, but he had a tight grip on the\\n\\nhandle bars. He whizzed past the auto, but, as the latter\\n\\ngathered speed, it crept up to him, and, once more was on even\\n\\nterms. Much chagrined at seeing Tom hold pace with him, even for\\n\\nan instant, Andy shouted;\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Get over on your own side there! You\\'re crowding me!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I am not!\" yelled back Tom, above the explosions of his\\n\\nmachine.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe two were now racing furiously, and Andy, with a savage\\n\\nlook, tried to get more speed out of his car. In spite of all the\\n\\nbully did, Tom was gradually forging ahead. A little hill was now\\n\\nin view.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Here\\'s where I make him take my dust!\" cried Andy, but, to his\\n\\nsurprise Tom still kept ahead. The auto began to lose ground, for\\n\\nit was not made to take hills on high gear.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Change to third gear quick!\" cried Sam.\\n\\n\\n\\nAndy tried to do it. There was a hesitancy on the part of his\\n\\ncar. It seemed to balk. Tom, looking back, slowed up a trifle. He\\n\\ncould afford to, as Andy was being beaten.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Go on! Go on!\" begged Pete. \"You\\'ll have to keep on fourth\\n\\ngear to beat him, Andy.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s what!\" murmured the bully. Once more he shifted the\\n\\ngears. There was a grinding, smashing sound, and the car lost\\n\\nspeed. Then it slowed up still more, and finally stopped. Then it\\n\\nbegan to back down hill.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ve stripped those blamed gears!\" exclaimed Andy ruefully.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Can\\'t you beat him?\" asked Pete.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I could have, easily, if my gears hadn\\'t broken,\" declared the\\n\\nbully, but, as a matter of fact, he could not have done so. \"I\\n\\noughtn\\'t to have changed, going up hill,\" he added, as he jammed\\n\\non the brakes, to stop the car from sliding down the slope.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom saw and heard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I thought you were so anxious to race,\" he said, exultantly,\\n\\nas well he might. \"I don\\'t want to try a contest down hill,\\n\\nthough, Andy,\" and he laughed at the red-haired lad, who was\\n\\nfurious.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Aw, go on!\" was all the retort the squint-eyed one could think\\n\\nof to make.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I am going on,\" replied our hero. \"Just to show you that I can\\n\\ngo down hill, watch me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe turned his motor-cycle, and approached Andy\\'s stalled car,\\n\\nfor Tom was some distance in advance of it, up the slope by this\\n\\ntime. As he approached the auto, containing the three\\n\\ndisconcerted cronies, something bounded out of Tom\\'s pocket. It\\n\\nwas the bottle of stove blacking he had purchased for Mrs.\\n\\nBaggert. The bottle fell in the soft dirt in front of his forward\\n\\nwheel, and a curious thing happened. Perhaps you have seen a\\n\\nbicycle or auto tire strike a stone at an angle, and throw it\\n\\ninto the air with great force. That was what happened to the\\n\\nbottle. Tom\\'s front wheel struck the cork, which fitted tightly,\\n\\nand, just as when you hit one end of the wooden \"catty\" and it\\n\\nbounds up, the bottle described a curve through the air, and flew\\n\\nstraight toward Andy\\'s car. It struck the brass frame of the wind\\n\\nshield with a crash.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe bottle broke, and in an instant the black liquid was\\n\\nspattered all over Andy, Sam and Pete. It could not have been\\n\\ndone more effectively if Tom had thrown it by hand. All over\\n\\ntheir clothes, their hands and faces, and the front of the car\\n\\nwent the dreary black. Tom looked on, hardly able to believe what\\n\\nhe saw.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Wow! Wup! Ug! Blug! Mug!\" spluttered Sam, who had some of the\\n\\nstuff in his mouth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh! Oh!\" yelled Pete.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You did that on purpose, Tom Swift!\" shouted Andy, wiping some\\n\\nof the blacking from his left eye. \"I\\'ll have you arrested for\\n\\nthat! You\\'ve ruined my car, and look at my suit!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Mine\\'s worse!\" murmured Sam, glancing down at his light\\n\\ntrousers, which were of the polka-dot pattern now.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, mine is,\" insisted Pete, whose white shirt was of the hue\\n\\nof a stove pipe.\\n\\n\\n\\nAndy wiped some of the black stuff from his nose, whence it was\\n\\ndropping on the steering wheel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You just wait!\" the bully called to Tom. \"I\\'ll get even with\\n\\nyou for this!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It was an accident! I didn\\'t mean to do that,\" explained Tom,\\n\\ntrying not to laugh, as he dismounted from his motorcycle, ready\\n\\nto render what assistance he could.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV              TALK OF A NEW BANK\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe three cronies were in a sorrowful plight. The black fluid\\n\\ndripped from them, and formed little puddles in the car. Andy had\\n\\nused his handkerchief to wipe some of the stuff from his face,\\n\\nbut the linen was soon useless, for it quickly absorbed the\\n\\nblacking.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There\\'s a little brook over here,\" volunteered Tom. \"You might\\n\\nwash in that. The stuff comes off easily. It isn\\'t like ink,\" and\\n\\nhe had to laugh, as he thought of the happening.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Here! You quit that!\" ordered Andy. \"You\\'ve gone too far, Tom\\n\\nSwift!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t I tell you it was an accident?\" inquired the young\\n\\ninventor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It wasn\\'t!\" cried Sam. \"You threw the bottle at us! I saw\\n\\nyou!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It slipped from my pocket,\" declared the youth, and he\\n\\ndescribed how the accident occurred. \"I\\'ll help you clean your\\n\\ncar, Andy,\" he added.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want your help! If you come near me I\\'ll--I\\'ll punch\\n\\nyour nose!\" cried Andy, now almost beside himself with rage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"All right, if you don\\'t want my help I don\\'t care,\" answered\\n\\nTom, glad enough not to have to soil his hands and clothes. He\\n\\nfelt that it was partly his fault, and he would have done all he\\n\\ncould to remedy matters, but his good offers being declined, he\\n\\nfelt that it was useless to insist further.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe remounted his motor-cycle, and rode off, the last view he\\n\\nhad of the trio being one where they were at the edge of the\\n\\nbrook, trying to remove the worst traces of the black fluid. As\\n\\nTom turned around for a final glimpse, Andy shook his fist at\\n\\nhim, and called out something.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I guess Andy\\'ll have it in for me,\" mused Tom. \"Well, I can\\'t\\n\\nhelp it. I owed him something on account, but I didn\\'t figure on\\n\\npaying it in just this way,\" and he thought of the time the bully\\n\\nhad locked him in the ballast tanks of the submarine, thereby\\n\\nnearly smothering him to death.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat night Andy Foger told his father what had happened, for\\n\\nMr. Foger inquired the reason for the black stains on his son\\'s\\n\\nface and hands. But Andy did not give the true version. He said\\n\\nTom had purposely thrown the bottle of blacking at him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So that\\'s the kind of a lad Tom Swift is, eh?\" remarked Andy\\'s\\n\\nfather. \"Well, Andy, I think you will soon have a chance to get\\n\\neven with him.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"How, pop?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I can\\'t tell you now, but I have a plan for making Tom sorry\\n\\nhe ever did anything to you, and I will also pay back some old\\n\\nscores to Mr. Swift and Mr. Damon. I\\'ll ruin their bank for them,\\n\\nthat\\'s what I\\'ll do.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ruin their bank, pop? How?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You wait and see. The Swift crowd will get off their high\\n\\nhorse soon, or I\\'m mistaken. My plans are nearly completed, but I\\n\\ncan\\'t tell you about them. I\\'ll ruin Mr. Swift, though, that\\'s\\n\\nwhat I\\'ll do,\" and Mr. Foger shook his head determinedly.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom was soon at his home, and Mrs. Baggert, hearing the noise\\n\\nof his machine, as it entered the front yard, came to the side\\n\\ndoor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Where\\'s my blacking?\" she asked, as our hero dismounted and\\n\\nuntied the bundle of steel tubes he had purchased.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I--I used it,\" he answered, laughing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Tom Swift! You don\\'t mean to say you took my stove polish to\\n\\nuse in your battery, do you?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, I used it to polish off Andy Foger and some of his\\n\\ncronies,\" and the young inventor told, with much gusto, what had\\n\\nhappened. Mrs. Baggert could not help joining in the laugh, and\\n\\nwhen Tom offered to ride back and purchase some more of the\\n\\npolish for her, she said it did not matter, as she could wait\\n\\nuntil the next day.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe lad was soon busy in his machine shop, making several\\n\\nlarger cells for the new storage battery. He wanted to give it a\\n\\nmore severe test. He worked for several days on this, and when he\\n\\nhad one unit of cells complete, he attached the motor for an\\n\\nefficiency trial.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We\\'ll see how many miles that will make,\" he remarked to his\\n\\nfather.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Have you thought anything of the type of car you are going to\\n\\nbuild?\" asked the aged inventor of his son.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, somewhat. It will be almost of the regulation style, but\\n\\nwith two removable seats at the rear, with curtains for\\n\\nprotection, and a place in front for two persons. This can also\\n\\nbe protected with curtains when desired.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But what about the motors and the battery?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThey will be located under the middle of the car. There will be\\n\\none set of batteries there, together with the motor, and another\\n\\nset of batteries will be placed under the removable seats in what\\n\\nI call the tonneau, though, of course, it isn\\'t really that. A\\n\\nsmaller set will also be placed forward, and there will be ample\\n\\nroom for carrying tools and such things.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"About how far do you expect your car will go with one charging\\n\\nof the battery?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, if I can make it do three hundred miles I\\'ll be\\n\\nsatisfied, but I\\'m going to try for four hundred.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What will you do when your battery runs out?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Recharge it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Suppose you\\'re not near a charging station?\"  \"Well, Dad, of\\n\\ncourse those are some of the details I\\'ve got to work out. I\\'m\\n\\nplanning a register gauge now, that will give warning about fifty\\n\\nmiles before the battery is run down. That will leave me a margin\\n\\nto work on. And I\\'m going to have it fixed so I can take current\\n\\nfrom any trolley line, as well as from a regular charging\\n\\nstation. My battery will be capable of being recharged very\\n\\nquickly, or, in case of need, I can take out the old cells and\\n\\nput in new ones.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s a very good idea. Well, I hope you succeed.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nA few evenings after this, when Tom was busy in his machine\\n\\nshop, he heard some one enter. He looked up from the gauge of the\\n\\nmotor, which he was studying, and, for a moment, he could make\\n\\nout nothing in the dark interior of the shop, for he was working\\n\\nin a brilliant light.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Who\\'s there?\" he called sharply, for, more than once\\n\\nunscrupulous men had endeavored to sneak into the Swift shops to\\n\\nsteal ideas of inventions; if not the actual apparatus itself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s me--Ned Newton,\" was the cheerful reply.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, hello, Ned! I was wondering what had become of you,\"\\n\\nresponded Tom. \"Where have you been lately?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, working overtime.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s the occasion?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We\\'re trying out a new system to increase the bank business.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter? Aren\\'t you folks getting business enough,\\n\\nafter the big deposits we made of the bullion from the wreck?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s not that. But haven\\'t you heard the news? There is\\n\\ntalk of starting a rival bank in Shopton, and that may make us\\n\\nhustle to hold what business we have, to say nothing of getting\\n\\nnew customers.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"A new bank, eh? Who\\'s going to start it?\" \"Andy Foger\\'s\\n\\nfather, I hear. You know he was a director in our bank, but he\\n\\ngot out last week.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What for?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, he had some difficulty with Mr. Pendergast, the\\n\\npresident. I fancy you had something to do with it, too.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I?\"  Tom was plainly surprised.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, you know you and Mr. Damon and Mr. Sharp captured the\\n\\nbank robbers, and got back most of the money.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I guess I do remember it! I wish you could have seen the gang\\n\\nwhen we raided them from the clouds, in our airship!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, you know Andy Foger hoped to collect the five thousand\\n\\ndollars reward for telling the police that you were the thief,\\n\\nand of course he got fooled, for you got the reward. Mr. Foger\\n\\nexpected his son would collect the money, and when Andy got left,\\n\\nit made him sore. He\\'s had a grudge against Mr. Pendergast, and\\n\\nall the other bank officials ever since, and now he\\'s going to\\n\\nstart a rival bank. So that\\'s why I said it was partly due to\\n\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, I see. I thought at first you meant that it was on account\\n\\nof something that happened the other day.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What was that?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Andy, Sam and Pete got the contents of a bottle of stove\\n\\nblacking,\" and Tom related the occurrence, at which Ned laughed\\n\\nheartily.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t be surprised though,\" added Ned, \"to learn that Mr.\\n\\nFoger started the new bank more for revenge than anything else.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So that\\'s the reason you\\'ve been working late, eh?\" went on\\n\\nTom. \"Getting ready for competition. Do you think a new bank will\\n\\nhurt the one you\\'re with?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, it might,\" admitted Ned. \"It\\'s bound to make a change,\\n\\nanyhow, and now that I have a good position I don\\'t want to lose\\n\\nit. I take more of an interest in the institution now that I\\'m\\n\\nassistant cashier, than I did when I was a clerk. So, naturally,\\n\\nI\\'m a little worried.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Say, don\\'t let it worry you,\" begged Tom, earnestly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why not?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Because I know my father and Mr. Damon will stick to the old\\n\\nbank. They won\\'t have anything to do with the one Andy Foger\\'s\\n\\nfather starts. Don\\'t you worry.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, that will help some,\" declared Ned. \"They are both heavy\\n\\ndepositors, and if they stick to the old bank we can stand it\\n\\neven if some of our smaller customers desert us.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s the way to talk,\" went on the young inventor. \"Let\\n\\nFoger start his bank. It won\\'t hurt yours.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What are you making now?\" asked Ned, a little later, looking\\n\\nwith interest at the machinery over which Tom was bending, and to\\n\\nwhich he was making adjustments.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"New electric automobile. I want to beat Andy Foger\\'s car worse\\n\\nthan I did on my motorcycle, and I also want to win a prize,\" and\\n\\nthe lad proceeded to relate the incidents leading up to his\\n\\nconstruction of the storage battery.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom and Ned were in the shop until long past midnight, and then\\n\\nthe bank employee, with a look at his watch, exclaimed:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Great Scott! I ought to be home.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll run you over in Mr. Damon\\'s car,\" proposed Tom. \"He left\\n\\nit here the other day, while he and his wife went off on a trip,\\n\\nand he said I could use it whenever I wanted to.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Good!\" cried Ned.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe two lads came from Tom\\'s particular workshop. As the young\\n\\ninventor closed the door he started suddenly, as he snapped shut\\n\\nthe lock.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" asked Ned quickly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I thought I heard a noise,\" replied Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey both listened. There was a slight rustling in some bushes\\n\\nnear the shop.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s a dog or a cat,\" declared Ned.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom took several cautious steps forward. Then he gave a spring,\\n\\nand made a grab for some one or something.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Here! You let me be!\" yelled a protesting voice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I will when I find out what you mean by sneaking around here,\"\\n\\nretorted Tom, as he came back toward Ned, dragging with him a\\n\\nlad. \"It wasn\\'t a dog or a cat, Ned,\" spoke the young inventor.\\n\\n\"It\\'s Sam Snedecker,\" and so it proved.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You let me alone!\" demanded Andy Foger\\'s crony. \"I ain\\'t done\\n\\nnothin\\' to you,\" he whined.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Here, Ned, you hold him a minute, while I make an\\n\\ninvestigation,\" called Tom, handing his prisoner over to his\\n\\nchum. \"Maybe Pete or Andy are around.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, they ain\\'t. I came alone,\" said Sam quickly, but Tom, not\\n\\nheeding, opened the shop, and, after turning on the electric\\n\\nlights, procured a lantern. He began a search of the shrubbery\\n\\naround the shop, while Ned held to the struggling Sam.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V               A MIDNIGHT ENCOUNTER\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe moment Tom disappeared behind his machine shop, Sam\\n\\nSnedecker began a desperate struggle to escape from Ned Newton.\\n\\nNow Ned was a muscular lad, but his work in the bank was\\n\\nconfining, and he did not have the chance to get out doors and\\n\\nexercise, as Sam had. Consequently Ned had his hands full in\\n\\nholding to the squirming crony of Andy Foger.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You let me go!\" demanded Sam, as he tried to twist loose.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not if I know it!\" panted Ned.\\n\\n\\n\\nSam gave a sudden twist. Ned\\'s foot slipped in the grass, and\\n\\nin a moment he went down, with Sam on top of him. Still he did\\n\\nnot let go, and, finding he was still a prisoner Sam adopted new\\n\\ntactics.\\n\\n\\n\\nUsing his fists Sam began to pound Ned, but the bank employee,\\n\\nthough suffering, would not call for help, to summon back Tom,\\n\\nwho was, by this time, at the rear of the shop, looking about.\\n\\nSilently in the dark the two fought, and Ned found that Sam was\\n\\ngetting away. Then Ned\\'s hand came in contact with Sam\\'s ear. It\\n\\nwas the misfortune of the bully to have rather a large hearing\\n\\napparatus, and once Ned got his fingers on an ear there was room\\n\\nenough to afford a good grip. He closed his hold tightly, and\\n\\nbegan to twist. This was too much for Sam. He set up a lusty\\n\\nhowl.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Wow! Ouch! Let go!\" he pleaded, and he ceased to pound Ned,\\n\\nand no longer tried to escape. Tom came back on the run.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" he cried. Then his light flashed on the\\n\\ntwo prostrate lads, and he understood without asking any further\\n\\nquestions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Get up!\" he cried, seizing Sam by the back of his neck, and\\n\\nyanking him to his feet. Ned arose, and secured a better grip on\\n\\nthe sneaking lad.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s up?\" demanded Tom, and Ned explained, following it by\\n\\nthe question:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"See any more of \\'em?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, I guess he was here all alone,\" replied the young\\n\\ninventor. \"What do you mean by sneaking around here this time of\\n\\nnight?\" he demanded of the captive.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you wish you knew?\" was Sam\\'s answer, with a leer. He\\n\\nrealized that he had a certain advantage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'d better tell before I turn you over to the police!\" said\\n\\nTom, sternly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You--you wouldn\\'t do that; would you?\" and Sam\\'s voice that\\n\\nhad been bold, became shaky.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You were trespassing on our property, and that\\'s against the\\n\\nlaw,\" declared Tom. \"We have signs posted, warning people to keep\\n\\noff.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t mean any harm,\" whined Sam.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then what were you doing here, at this hour?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I was just taking a short cut home. I was out riding with Andy\\n\\nin his auto, and it broke down. I had to walk home, and I came\\n\\nthis way. I didn\\'t know you didn\\'t allow people to cross your\\n\\nback lot. I wasn\\'t doin\\' anything.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom hesitated. Sam might be telling the truth, but it was\\n\\ndoubtful.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What happened to Andy\\'s auto?\" the young inventor asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He broke a wheel, going over a big stone on Berk\\'s hill. He\\n\\nwent to tell some one in the repair shop to go after the car, and\\n\\nI came on home. You\\'ve got no right to arrest me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I ought to, on general principles,\" commented Tom. \"Well, skip\\n\\nout, and don\\'t you come around here again. I\\'m going to get a\\n\\nsavage bull dog, and the first one who comes sneaking around here\\n\\nafter dark will be sorry. Move along now!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom and Ned released their holds of Sam, and the latter lost no\\n\\ntime in obeying the injunction to make himself scarce. He was\\n\\nsoon lost to sight in the darkness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Think he was up to some mischief?\" asked Ned.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m almost sure of it,\" replied Tom, \"but I can\\'t see anything\\n\\nwrong. I guess we were too quick for him. I believe he, Andy and\\n\\nPete Bailey tried to put up some job on me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Maybe they wanted to damage your new battery or car,\"\\n\\nsuggested Ned.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hardly that. The car hasn\\'t been started yet, and as for the\\n\\nbattery, no one knows of it outside of you and my friends here.\\n\\nI\\'m keeping it secret. Well, if I\\'m going to take you home I\\'d\\n\\nbetter get a move on. Wait here and I\\'ll run out Mr. Damon\\'s\\n\\ncar.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a short time Tom was guiding the machine over the road to\\n\\nShopton, Ned on the seat beside him. The young assistant cashier\\n\\nlived about a mile the other side of the village, and the two\\n\\nchums were soon at his house. Asking his friend to come and see\\n\\nhim when he had a chance. Ned bid his chum good night, and the\\n\\nyoung inventor started back home.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was driving slowly along, thinking more of his new invention\\n\\nthan anything else, even more than of the mysterious visit of Sam\\n\\nSnedecker, when the lights on Mr. Damon\\'s car flashed upon\\n\\nsomething big, black and bulky on the road just ahead of him.\\n\\nTom, brought suddenly out of his fit of musing, jammed on the\\n\\nbrakes, and steered to one side. Then he saw that the object was\\n\\na stalled auto. He had only time to note this when a voice hailed\\n\\nhim:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Have you a tire pump you could lend us? Ours doesn\\'t work, and\\n\\nwe have had a blowout.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was something about the voice that was strangely\\n\\nfamiliar, and Tom was wondering where he had heard it before,\\n\\nwhen into the glare of the lamps on his machine stepped Mr.\\n\\nFoger--Andy\\'s father!\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why, Mr. Foger!\" exclaimed Tom. \"I didn\\'t know it was you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s Tom Swift,\" remarked the man, and he did not seem\\n\\nespecially pleased.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hey! What\\'s that?\" cried another voice, which Tom had no\\n\\ndifficulty in recognizing as belonging to Andy. \"What\\'s the\\n\\nmatter, Dad?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why it happens to be your--ahem! It\\'s Tom Swift in this other\\n\\nauto,\" went on Mr. Foger. \"I didn\\'t know you had a car,\" he\\n\\nadded.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t,\" answered the lad. \"This belongs to Mr. Damon. But\\n\\ncan you see to fix your tire in the dark?\" for Mr. Foger and his\\n\\nson had no lamps lighted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, we have it all fixed,\" declared the man, \"and, just as we\\n\\nwere going to pump it up out lamps went out. Then we found that\\n\\nour pump wouldn\\'t work. If you have one I would be obliged for\\n\\nthe use of it,\" and he spoke somewhat stiffly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" agreed Tom, cheerfully, for he had no special\\n\\ngrudge against Mr. Foger, though had he known Andy\\'s father\\'s\\n\\nplans, perhaps our hero would not have so readily aided him. The\\n\\nyoung inventor got down, removed one of his oil lamps in order\\n\\nthat there might be some light on the operation, and then brought\\n\\nover his pump.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I heard you had an accident,\" said Tom, a chain of thoughts\\n\\nbeing rapidly forged in his mind, as he thought of what Sam had\\n\\ntold him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You heard of it?\" repeated Mr. Foger, while Andy was busy\\n\\npumping up the tire.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, a friend who was out riding with you said you had broken\\n\\na wheel on Berk\\'s hill. But I see he was slightly wrong. You\\'re a\\n\\ngood way from Berk\\'s hill, and it\\'s a tire that is broken, not a\\n\\nwheel.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But I don\\'t understand,\" said Mr. Foger. \"No friend has been\\n\\nout riding with us. My son and I were out on a business trip,\\n\\nand--\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Come on, pop. I\\'ve got it all pumped up. Jump in. There\\'s your\\n\\npump, Tom Swift. Much obliged,\" muttered Andy hastily.  It was\\n\\nvery evident that he wanted to prevent any further conversation\\n\\nbetween his parent and Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But I don\\'t understand,\" went on the banker, clearly puzzled.\\n\\n\"What friend gave you such information, Mr.--er--Tom Swift?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Sam Snedecker,\" replied the lad quickly. \"I caught him\\n\\nsneaking around my machine shop about an hour ago, and when I\\n\\nasked him what he was doing he said he\\'d been out riding with\\n\\nAndy, and that they broke a wheel. I\\'m glad it was only a blown-\\n\\nout tire,\" and Tom\\'s voice had a curious note in it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But there must be some mistake,\" insisted Mr. Foger. \"Sam\\n\\nSnedecker was not riding with us this evening. We have been over\\n\\nto Waterfield--my son and I, and--\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Come on, pop!\" cried Andy desperately. \"We must hurry home.\\n\\nMom will be worried.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, I think she will. But I can\\'t understand why Sam should\\n\\nsay such a thing. However, we are much obliged for the use of\\n\\nyour pump, Swift, and--\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Andy prevented any further talk by starting the car with\\n\\nthe muffler open, making a great racket, and he hurriedly drove\\n\\noff, almost before his father was seated, leaving Tom standing\\n\\nthere in the road, beside his pump and lantern.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So,\" mused the young inventor, \"there\\'s some game on. Sam\\n\\nwasn\\'t with Andy, yet Andy evidently knew where Sam was, or he\\n\\nwouldn\\'t have been so anxious to choke off talk. Mr. Foger knew\\n\\nnothing of Sam, naturally. But why have Andy and his father been\\n\\non a midnight trip to Waterfield?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThat last question caused Tom to adopt a new line of thought.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Waterfield,\" he mused. \"That\\'s where Mr. Damon lives. Mr.\\n\\nDamon is a heavy depositor in the old bank. Mr. Foger is going to\\n\\nstart a new bank. I wonder if there\\'s any connection there? This\\n\\nis getting mysterious. I must keep my eyes open. I never expected\\n\\nto meet Andy and his father tonight, any more than I expected to\\n\\nfind Sam Snedecker sneaking around my shop, but it\\'s a good thing\\n\\nI discovered both parties. I guess Andy must have had nervous\\n\\nprostration when I was talking to his father,\" and Tom grinned at\\n\\nthe thought. Then, picking up the pump, and fastening the lantern\\n\\nin place, he drove Mr. Damon\\'s auto slowly back home.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom said nothing to his father or Mr. Sharp, the next morning,\\n\\nabout the incidents of the previous night. In the first place he\\n\\ncould not exactly understand them, and he wanted to devote more\\n\\ntime to thinking of them, before he mentioned the matter to his\\n\\nparent. Another reason was that Mr. Swift was a very nervous\\n\\nperson, and the least thing out of the ordinary worried him. So\\n\\nthe young inventor concluded to keep quiet.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis first act, after going to look at the small motor, which\\n\\nwas being run with the larger, experimental storage battery, was\\n\\nto get out pencil and paper.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got to plan the electric auto now that my battery is in a\\n\\nfair way to success,\" he said, for he noted that the one cell he\\n\\nhad constructed had done over twice as much mileage in\\n\\nproportion, as had the small battery. \"I\\'ll soon start building\\n\\nthe car,\" mused Tom, \"and then I\\'ll enter it in the race. I must\\n\\nwrite to that touring club and find how much time I have.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAll that morning the young inventor drew plan after plan for an\\n\\nelectric runabout, and rejected them. Finally he threw aside\\n\\npaper and pencil and exclaimed:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s no use. I can\\'t think to-day. I\\'m dwelling too much on\\n\\nwhat happened last night. I must clear my brain.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I know what I\\'ll do. I\\'ll get in my motor-boat and take a run\\n\\nover to Waterfield to see Mr. Damon. Maybe he\\'s home by this\\n\\ntime. Then I can ask him what Mr. Foger wanted to see him about,\\n\\nif he did call.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was a fine May morning, and Tom was soon in his boat, the\\n\\nArrow, gliding over Lake Carlopa, the waters of which sparkled in\\n\\nthe sun. As he speeded up his craft, the lad looked about,\\n\\nthinking he might catch sight of Andy Foger, for the bully also\\n\\nowned a boat, called the Red Streak and, more than once, in spite\\n\\nof the fact that Andy\\'s craft was the more powerful, Tom had\\n\\nbeaten him in impromptu races. But there was no sign of his rival\\n\\nthis morning, and Tom kept on to Waterfield. He found that Mr.\\n\\nDamon had not yet returned home.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So far I\\'ve had my run for nothing,\" mused the youth. \"Well, I\\n\\nmight as well spend the rest of the morning in the boat.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe swung his craft out into the lake, and headed back toward\\n\\nMansburg, intending to run up to the head of the body of water,\\n\\nwhich offered so many attractions that beautiful morning.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs Tom passed a small dock he saw a girl just putting out in a\\n\\nrowboat. The figure looked familiar and, having nothing special\\n\\nto do, the lad steered over closer. His first view was confirmed,\\n\\nand he called out cheerfully:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Good morning, Miss Nestor. Going for a row?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh! Mr. Swift!\" exclaimed the girl with a blush.  \"I didn\\'t\\n\\nhear you coming. You startled me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, the engine runs quite silently since I fixed it,\" resumed\\n\\nTom. \"But where are you going?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I was going for a row,\" answered the girl, \"but I have just\\n\\ndiscovered that one of the oar locks is broken, so I am not going\\n\\nfor a row,\" and she laughed, showing her white, even teeth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s too bad!\" remarked the lad. \"I don\\'t suppose,\" he added\\n\\ndoubtfully, \"that I could induce you to accept a motor-boat as a\\n\\nsubstitute for a rowing craft, could I?\" and he looked\\n\\nquizzically at her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Are you asking me that as a hypothetical question?\" she\\n\\ninquired.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Tom, trying not to smile.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, if you are asking for information, merely, I will say\\n\\nthat I could he induced to make such a change,\" and her face was\\n\\nnearly as grave as that of the young inventor\\'s.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What inducement would have to be used?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Suppose you just ask me in plain English to come and have a\\n\\nride?\" she suggested.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"All right, I will!\" exclaimed the youth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"All right, then I\\'ll come!\" she retorted with a laugh, and a\\n\\nfew minutes later the two were in the Arrow, making a pretty\\n\\npicture as they speeded up the lake.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI              BUILDING THE CAR\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" remarked Tom to himself, about two hours later, when he\\n\\nhad left Mary Nestor at her dock, and was on his way home, \"I\\n\\nfeel better than I did, and now I must do some hard thinking\\n\\nabout my runabout. I want to get it the right shape to make the\\n\\nleast resistance.\" He began to make some sketches when he got\\n\\nhome, and at dinner he showed them to his father and Mr. Sharp.\\n\\nHe said he had gotten an idea from looking at the airship.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m going to make the front part, or what corresponds to the\\n\\nengine-hood in a gasolene car, pointed,\" he explained. \"It will\\n\\nbe just like the front of the aluminum gas container of the\\n\\nairship, only built of steel. In it will be a compartment for a\\n\\nset of batteries, and there will be a searchlight there. From the\\n\\ntop of some supporters in front of the two rear seats, a slanting\\n\\nsheet of steel will come right down to meet the sloping nose of\\n\\nthe car. First I was going to have curtains close over the top of\\n\\nthe driver\\'s seat, but I think a steel covering, with a celluloid\\n\\nopening will be better and make less wind resistance. I\\'ll use\\n\\nleather side curtains when it rains. Under the front seats will\\n\\nbe a compartment for more batteries, and there will be a third\\n\\nplace under the rear seats, where I will also carry spare wheels\\n\\nand a repair kit. The motors will be slung under the body of the\\n\\ncar, amidships, and there will also be room for some batteries\\n\\nthere.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"How are you going to drive the car?\" asked Mr. Sharp. \"By a\\n\\nshaft?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Chain drive,\" explained Tom. \"I can get more power that way,\\n\\nand it will be more flexible under heavy loads. Of course it will\\n\\nbe steered in the usual way, and near the wheel will be the\\n\\nstarting and reversing levers, and the gear handle.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Gears!\" exclaimed the aged inventor. \"Are you going to gear an\\n\\nelectric auto? I never heard of that. Usually the motor directly\\n\\nconnected is all they use.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m going to have two gears on mine,\" decided Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s a new idea,\" commented the aeronaut.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It is,\" admitted the lad, \"and that\\'s why my car is going to\\n\\nbe so speedy. I\\'ll make her go a hundred miles an hour, if\\n\\nnecessary!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Nonsense!\" exclaimed his father.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I will!\" cried the young inventor, enthusiastically. \"You just\\n\\nwait and see. I couldn\\'t do it but for the gears, but by using\\n\\nthem I\\'ll secure more speed, especially with the big reserve\\n\\nbattery power I\\'ll have. I know I\\'ve got the right idea, and I\\'m\\n\\ngoing to get right to work.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHis father and Mr. Sharp were much interested, and closely\\n\\nexamined his sketches. In a few days Tom had made detailed\\n\\ndrawings, and the aged inventor looked at them critically. He had\\n\\nto admit that his son\\'s theory was right, though how it would\\n\\nwork out in practice was yet to be demonstrated. Mr. Swift\\n\\noffered some suggestions for minor changes, as did Mr. Sharp, and\\n\\nthe lad adopted some of them. Then, with Mr. Jackson to help him,\\n\\nwork was started on constructing the car.\\n\\n\\n\\nCertain parts of it could be better purchased in the open\\n\\nmarket instead of being manufactured in Mr. Swift\\'s shop, and\\n\\nthus Tom was able to get his new invention into some sort of\\n\\nshape sooner than would otherwise have been the case. He also\\n\\nstarted making the batteries, many of which would be needed.\\n\\n\\n\\nGradually the car began to take form on the floor of Tom\\'s\\n\\nshop. It was rather a curious looking affair, the sharp forward\\n\\npart making it appear like some engine of war, or a projectile\\n\\nfor some monster gun. But Tom cared little for looks. Speed,\\n\\nstrength and ease of control were the chief features the lad\\n\\naimed at, and he incorporated many new ideas into his electric\\n\\ncar.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was busy in the shop, one morning, when, above the noise\\n\\ncaused by filing a piece of steel he heard some one exclaim:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my gizzard! If you aren\\'t as busy as ever!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Mr. Damon!\" cried Tom in delight. \"When did you get back?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Last night,\" replied the eccentric man. \"My wife and I stayed\\n\\nlonger than we meant to. And whom do you think we met when we\\n\\nwere off on our little trip?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Some of the Happy Harry gang?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh no. You\\'d never guess, so I\\'ll tell you. It was Captain\\n\\nWeston.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Indeed! And how has he been since he went in the submarine\\n\\nwith us, and helped recover the gold from the wreck?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Very well. The first thing he said to me was: \\'How is Tom\\n\\nSwift and his father, if I may be permitted to ask?\\'\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ha! Ha!\" laughed the lad, at the recollection of the odd sea\\n\\ncaptain, who generally tagged on an apologetic expression to most\\n\\nof his remarks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He was getting ready to take part in some South American\\n\\nrevolution,\" went on Mr. Damon. \"He used most of his money that\\n\\nhe got from the wreck to help finance their cause.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I must tell Mr. Sharp,\" went on the lad. \"He\\'ll be\\n\\ninterested.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Anything new since I\\'ve been away?\" asked the odd man. \"Bless\\n\\nmy shoe laces, but I\\'m glad to get back!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom told of the prospect of a new bank being started, and of\\n\\nSam\\'s midnight visit, as well as the encounter with Mr. Foger and\\n\\nAndy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I went over to see what Mr. Foger wanted of you,\" went on the\\n\\nyoung inventor, \"but you weren\\'t home. Did he call?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The servant said he had been there, not once, but several\\n\\ntimes,\" remarked Mr. Damon. \"That reminds me. He left a note for\\n\\nme, and I haven\\'t read it yet. I\\'ll do so now.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe tore open the letter, and hastily perused the contents.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ha!\" he exclaimed. \"So that\\'s what he wanted to see me about!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What?\" inquired Tom, with the privilege of and old friend.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Mr. Foger says he\\'s going to start a new bank, and he wants me\\n\\nto withdraw my deposit from the old one, and put it in his\\n\\ninstitution. Says he\\'ll pay me bigger interest. And he adds that\\n\\nsome of the old employees have gone with him.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I hope you\\'re not going to change,\" spoke Tom, thinking of his\\n\\nchum, Ned.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Indeed I\\'m not. The old bank is good enough for me. By the\\n\\nway, doesn\\'t a friend of yours work there?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, Ned Newton. I\\'m wondering how he\\'ll be affected?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you worry!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"Bless my check book!\\n\\nI\\'ll speak to Pendergast about your friend. Maybe there\\'ll be a\\n\\nchance to advance him further. I\\'ve got some mortgages falling\\n\\ndue pretty soon, and I\\'ll deposit the money from them in the old\\n\\nbank. Then we\\'ll see what we can do about Ned.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They\\'ll make you a bank director, if you keep on putting in\\n\\nmoney,\" remarked our hero, with a smile.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not much they won\\'t!\" was the quick answer\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my stocks and bonds! I\\'ve got trouble enough without\\n\\nbecoming a bank director.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy doctor says my liver is out of order again, and I\\'ve got to\\n\\neat a lemon every morning before breakfast.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Eat a lemon?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, drink the juice! It\\'s the same thing. But how is the\\n\\nelectric runabout coming on?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Pretty good.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Have you entered it in the races yet?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, but I\\'ve written for information. I have until September\\n\\nto finish it. The races take place then.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Let\\'s see; they\\'re on Long Island; aren\\'t they? How do you\\n\\ncalculate to do; run from here to there?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, Dad still has the cottage he rented when we built the\\n\\nsubmarine and I think I\\'ll make that my headquarters during the\\n\\nrace. It\\'s easy to run from there over to the Long Island track.\\n\\nThey\\'re building a new one, especially for the occasion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I hope you win the prize. I must go to town now, as I\\n\\nhave to attend to some business. I don\\'t s\\'pose you want to come\\n\\nin my auto. I\\'m pretty sure something will break before I get\\n\\nthere, and I\\'d like to have you along to fix it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Sorry, but I\\'m afraid I can\\'t go,\" replied the lad. \"I must\\n\\nget this car done, and then I\\'ve got to start on the batteries.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Damon rather reluctantly went off alone, looking anxiously\\n\\nat his car, for the machine got out of order on every trip he\\n\\ntook.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was a few days after this that Tom received a call from Ned\\n\\none evening. The bank employee\\'s face wore a happy smile.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter; some one left you a fortune?\" asked Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Pretty nearly as good. I\\'ve got a better position.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What? Have you left the old bank, and gone to the new one?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, I\\'m still in the same bank, but I\\'m one of the two\\n\\ncashiers now. Mr. Foger took several of the old employees when he\\n\\nopened his new bank, and that left vacancies. I was promoted, and\\n\\nso were one or two others. Mr. Damon spoke a good word for me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s fine! He\\'s a friend worth having.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s right. Your father also recommended me. But how are\\n\\nthings with you? Has Andy made any more trouble?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, and I don\\'t believe he will. I guess he\\'ll steer clear of\\n\\nme.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Tom was soon to learn he was mistaken.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII             TOM IS CAPTURED\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile the young inventor, aided by his father, Mr. Sharp\\n\\nand Garret Jackson, the engineer, worked hard over his new car,\\n\\nand the powerful batteries. A month passed, and such was the\\n\\nprogress made that Tom felt justified in making formal entry of\\n\\nhis vehicle for the races to be held by the Touring Club of\\n\\nAmerica.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe paid a contingent fee and was listed as one of the\\n\\ncompetitors. As is usual in an affair of this kind, the promoters\\n\\nof it desired publicity, and they sought it through the papers.\\n\\n\\n\\nConsequently each new entrant\\'s name was published. In addition\\n\\nsomething was said about his previous achievements in the speed\\n\\nline.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo sooner was the name of Tom Swift received by the officials\\n\\nof the club, than it was at once recalled that young Swift had\\n\\nhad a prominent part in the airship Red Cloud, and the submarine\\n\\nAdvance. This gave an enterprising reporter a chance for a\\n\\n\"special\" for the Sunday supplement of a New York newspaper.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom, it was stated, was building a car which would practically\\n\\nannihilate distance and time, and there were many weird pictures,\\n\\nshowing him flying along without touching the ground, in a car,\\n\\nthe pictorial construction of which was at once fearful and\\n\\nwonderful.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom and his friends laughed at the yarn, at first, but it soon\\n\\nhad undesirable results. The young inventor had desired to keep\\n\\nsecret the fact that he was building a new electric vehicle, and\\n\\na novel storage battery, but the article in the paper aroused\\n\\nconsiderable interest. Many persons came a long distance, hoping\\n\\nfor a sight of the wonderful car, as pictured in the Sunday\\n\\nsupplement, but they had to be denied. The news, thus leaking\\n\\nout, kept the Swift shops almost constantly besieged by many\\n\\ncurious ones, who sought, by various means, to gain admission.\\n\\nFinally Tom and his father, after posting large signs, warning\\n\\npersons to keep away, added others to the effect that undesirable\\n\\nvisitors might find themselves unexpectedly shocked by\\n\\nelectricity, if they ventured too close. This had the desired\\n\\neffect, though the wires which were strung about carried such a\\n\\nmild charge that it would not have harmed a child. Then the only\\n\\nbothersome characters were the boys of the town, and, fearless\\n\\nand careless lads, they persisted in hanging around the Swift\\n\\nhomestead, in the hope of seeing Tom dash away at the rate of\\n\\nfive hundred miles an hour, which one enthusiastic writer\\n\\npredicted he would do.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got a plan!\" exclaimed Tom one day when the boys had been\\n\\nparticularly troublesome.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What is it?\" asked his father.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We\\'ll hire Eradicate Sampson to stand guard with a bucket of\\n\\nwhitewash. He\\'ll keep the boys away.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe plan was put into operation, and Eradicate and his mule,\\n\\nBoomerang, were installed on the premises.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Deed an\\' Ah\\'ll keep dem lads away,\" promised the colored man.\\n\\n\"Ah\\'ll splash white stuff all ober \\'em, if dey comes traipsin\\'\\n\\naround me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was as good as his word, and, when one or two lads had\\n\\nreceived a dose of the stuff, which punishment was followed by\\n\\nmore severe from home, for having gotten their clothes soiled,\\n\\nthe nuisance ceased, to a certain extent. Sam Snedecker and Pete\\n\\nBailey were two who received a liberal sprinkling of the lime,\\n\\nand they vowed vengeance on Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And Andy Foger will help us, too,\" added Sam, as he withdrew,\\n\\nafter an encounter with Eradicate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Doan\\'t let dat worry yo\\', Mistah Swift!\" exclaimed the darkey.\\n\\n\"Jest let dat low-down-good-fo-nuffin\\' Andy Foger come \\'round me,\\n\\nan\\' Ah\\'ll make him t\\'ink he\\'s de inside ob a chicken coop, dat\\'s\\n\\nwhat Ah will.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nPerhaps Andy heard of this, and kept away. In the meanwhile Tom\\n\\nkept on perfecting his car and battery. From the club secretary\\n\\nhe learned that a number of inventors were working on electric\\n\\ncars, and there promised to be many of the speedy vehicles in the\\n\\nrace.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter considerable labor Tom had succeeded in getting together\\n\\none set of the batteries. He had them completed one afternoon,\\n\\nand wanted to give them a test that night. But, when he went to\\n\\nhis father\\'s chemical laboratory for a certain powder, which he\\n\\nneeded to use in the battery solution, he found there was none.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll have to ride in to Mansburg for some,\" he decided. \"I\\'ll\\n\\ngo after supper, on my motorcycle, and test the battery to-\\n\\nnight.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe young inventor left his house immediately after the evening\\n\\nmeal. Along the road toward Mansburg he speeded, and, as he came\\n\\nto the foot of a hill, where once Andy Foger had put a big tree,\\n\\nhoping Tom would run into it and be injured, the youth recalled\\n\\nthat circumstance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Andy has been keeping out of my way lately,\" mused Tom. \"I\\n\\nwonder if he\\'s up to any mischief? I don\\'t like the way Sam\\n\\nSnedecker is hanging around the shop, either. It looks as if they\\n\\nwere plotting something. But I guess Eradicate and his pail of\\n\\nwhitewash will scare them off.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom got the powdered chemical he wanted in the drug store, and,\\n\\nafter refreshing himself with some ice cream soda, he started\\n\\nback. As he rode along through the streets of the town he kept a\\n\\nlookout, and those of you who know how fond the lad was of a\\n\\ncertain young lady, do not need to be told for whom he was\\n\\nlooking. But he did not see her, and soon turned into the main\\n\\nhighway leading to Shopton.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was dark when he reached the hill, where once he had been so\\n\\nnear an accident, and he slowed up as he coasted down it, using\\n\\nthe brake at intervals.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom got safely to the bottom of the declivity, and was about to\\n\\nturn on the power of his machine, when, from the bushes that\\n\\nlined either side of the roadway, several figures sprang\\n\\nsuddenly. They ranged themselves across the road, and one cried:\\n\\n\"Halt!\" in tones that were meant to be stern, but which seemed to\\n\\nTom, to tremble somewhat. The young inventor was so surprised\\n\\nthat he did not open the gasolene throttle, nor switch on his\\n\\nspark. As a consequence his motor-cycle lost momentum, and he had\\n\\nto take one foot from the pedal and touch the ground, to prevent\\n\\nhimself from toppling over.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hold on there!\" cried another voice. \"We\\'ve got you where we\\n\\nwant you, now! Hold on! Don\\'t go!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I wasn\\'t going to go,\" responded Tom calmly, trying to\\n\\nrecognize the voice, which seemed to be unnatural. \"What do you\\n\\nwant, and who are you?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Never mind who we are. We want you and we\\'ve got you! Get off\\n\\nthat wheel!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t see why I should!\" exclaimed Tom, and he suddenly\\n\\nshifted his handle bars, so as to flash the bright headlight he\\n\\ncarried, upon the circle of dark figures that opposed his\\n\\nprogress. As the light flashed on them he was surprised to see\\n\\nthat all the figures wore masks over their faces.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom started. Was this the Happy Harry gang after him again? He\\n\\nhoped not, yet the fact that the persons had on masks made the\\n\\nhold-up have an ugly look. Once more Tom flashed the light on the\\n\\nthrong. There were exclamations of dismay.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Douse that glim, somebody!\" called a sharp voice, which Tom\\n\\ncould not recognize.\\n\\n\\n\\nA stone came whizzing through the air, from some one in the\\n\\ncrowd. There was a smashing of glass as it hit the lantern, and\\n\\nthe road was plunged in darkness. Tom tried to throw one leg over\\n\\nthe saddle, and let down the supporting stand from the rear\\n\\nwheel, so the motorcycle would remain upright without him holding\\n\\nit. He determined to have revenge for that act of vandalism in\\n\\nbreaking his lamp.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut, just as he was free of the seat, he was surrounded by a\\n\\ndozen persons, and several hands were laid on him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We\\'ve got you now!\" some one fairly hissed in his ear. \"Come\\n\\nalong, and get what\\'s coming to you!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom tried to fight, but he was overpowered by numbers and, a\\n\\nlittle later, was dragged off into the woods in the darkness by\\n\\nthe masked figures. His arms were securely bound with ropes, and\\n\\na handkerchief was tied over his eyes. Tom Swift was a prisoner.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII            A BLINDING FLASH\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStumbling on through the dark woods, led by his captors, Tom\\n\\ntried to pierce the gloom and identify the persons who had firm\\n\\ngrips on either side of him. But it was useless. A little light\\n\\nsifted down from the starlit sky above, but it was not\\n\\nsufficient. The young inventor was beginning to think, after all,\\n\\nthat he had fallen into the hands of the Happy Harry gang, and he\\n\\nknew that if this was so he need expect no mercy.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut two things were against this belief. One was that the\\n\\nprincipal members of the gang were still in jail, or at least\\n\\nthey were supposed to be, and another was that there were too\\n\\nmany of the captors. Happy Harry\\'s crowd never numbered so many.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Maybe they\\'re highwaymen,\" thought our hero, as he was dragged\\n\\nalong  \"But that can\\'t be,\" he reasoned further. \"If they wanted\\n\\nto rob me they\\'d have done it back there in the road, and not\\n\\nbrought me off here in the woods. Besides, I haven\\'t anything for\\n\\nthem to steal.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly Tom stumbled over a projecting root, and nearly fell,\\n\\ndragging along with him the person who had hold of his left arm.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Look out there! What\\'s the matter with you?\" exclaimed one of\\n\\nthe throng quickly, and at the sound of the voice Tom started.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Andy Foger!\" cried the young inventor, as he recovered\\n\\nhimself, for he had recognized the voice of the red-haired bully.\\n\\n\"What do you mean by holding me up in this way?\" he demanded.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Quiet!\" urged a voice in his ear, and the tones were\\n\\nunfamiliar. \"Mention no names!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m on to your game!\" retorted Tom. \"I know you\\'re here, Andy,\\n\\nand Sam and Pete; and Jack Reynolds and Sid Holton,\" and he named\\n\\ntwo rather loose-charactered lads, who were often in the company\\n\\nof Andy and his cronies. \"You\\'d better quit this nonsense,\" Tom\\n\\nwent on. \"I\\'ll cause the arrest of all of you if you make trouble\\n\\nfor me. I know who you are now!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You think you do,\" answered the voice in his ear, and the\\n\\nyoung inventor concluded that it must be some lad whom he did not\\n\\nknow. \"Nor is this nonsense,\" the other went on. \"You are about\\n\\nto receive the punishment due you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nOur hero did not answer, but he was doing some hard thinking.\\n\\nHe wondered why Andy and his crowd had captured him.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly the blackness of the woods was illuminated by the\\n\\nfitful gleam of a distant fire. Tom could see more plainly now,\\n\\nand he managed to count about ten dusky figures hurrying along,\\n\\nfour being close to him, to prevent his escape, and the others\\n\\nrunning on ahead. The light became stronger, and, a moment later\\n\\nthe prisoner and his captors emerged into a little clearing,\\n\\nwhere a fire was burning. Two figures, masked with black cloth,\\n\\nas were all in the crowd, stood about the blaze, putting on\\n\\nsticks of wood.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Did you get him?\" asked one of these figures eagerly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, they got me, Sam Snedecker,\" answered Tom quickly,\\n\\nrecognizing Sam\\'s tones. \"And they\\'ll wish they hadn\\'t before I\\'m\\n\\ndone with them.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Quiet!\" ordered an unknown voice. \"Members of the Deep Forest\\n\\nThrong, the prisoner is here!\" the lad went on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Tis well, bind the captive to the sacrificial tree,\" was the\\n\\nresponse from some one in the crowd.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom laughed. He was at ease now, for he recognized that those\\n\\nwho had taken him prisoner were all lads of Andy\\'s character.\\n\\nMost of them were Shopton youths, but some, evidently, were\\n\\nstrangers in town. Tom felt he had little to fear.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bring him over here,\" ordered one, and Tom cried out:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You wouldn\\'t be giving those orders, Andy Foger, if my arms\\n\\nweren\\'t tied. And if you\\'ll untie me, I\\'ll fight any two of you\\n\\nat once,\" offered the young inventor fiercely, for he hated the\\n\\nhumiliation to which he was being subjected.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Don\\'t do it! Don\\'t untie him!\" begged some one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No danger, they won\\'t. They\\'re afraid to, Pete Bailey,\"\\n\\nreplied Tom quickly, for he had recognized the voice of the other\\n\\none of Andy\\'s particular cronies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Aw, he knows who we are,\" whispered Sam, but not so low but\\n\\nthat our hero heard him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No matter,\" was Andy\\'s retort. \"Let\\'s go ahead with it. Tie\\n\\nhim to that tree.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was useless for Tom to struggle. He was bound too tightly by\\n\\nthe rope, and the crowd was too many for him. In a few minutes he\\n\\nwas securely fastened to a tree, not far from the camp-fire,\\n\\nwhich was replenished from time to time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Now for the judgment!\" called one of the masked lads, in what\\n\\nhe meant to be a sepulchral tone. \"What is the charge against the\\n\\nprisoner? Brother Number One of the Deep Forest Throng, what is\\n\\nyour accusation?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He\\'s a regular snob, that\\'s what\\'s the trouble,\"  answered\\n\\nAndy  Foger,  though whether he was \"Brother Number One,\" did not\\n\\nappear. \"He\\'s too fresh and--and--\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll make you wish you felt fresh when I get hold of you,\\n\\nAndy,\" murmured Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Quiet!\" cried a tall lad. \"What\\'s the next charge?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He keeps an old colored man on guard at his place,\" was the\\n\\nanswer, and Tom had no difficulty in recognizing the voice of Sid\\n\\nHolton. \"The coon throws whitewash all over us. I got some of\\n\\nit.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You wouldn\\'t have, if you\\'d minded your own business,\"\\n\\nretorted Tom. \"It served you right!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What is the verdict on the prisoner?\" asked one who seemed to\\n\\nbe the leader.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I say let\\'s tar and feather him!\" cried Andy suddenly.\\n\\n\"There\\'s a barrel of tar back in the woods here, and we can get\\n\\nsome feathers from a chicken coop. That would make him so he\\n\\nwouldn\\'t be so uppish, I guess!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s right! Tar and feathers!\" exclaimed several.\\n\\n\\n\\nOur hero\\'s heart sank. He was not afraid, but he did not relish\\n\\nthe indignity that was proposed. He resolved to fight to the last\\n\\nounce of his strength against the masked lads.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Can we get a kettle to heat the tar in?\" asked some one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We\\'ll find one,\" answered Sam Snedecker. \"Come on, let\\'s do\\n\\nit. You\\'ll look pretty, Tom Swift, when we\\'re through with you,\"\\n\\nhe exulted.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom did not answer, but there was fierce anger in his heart.\\n\\nThe tar and feather proposal seemed to meet with general favor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Members of the Deep Forest Throng, we will hold a\\n\\nconsultation,\" proposed the leader, in his assumed deep voice.\\n\\n\"Come over here, to one side. Brother Number Six, guard the\\n\\nprisoner well.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There ain\\'t no need to,\" answered a lad who had been\\n\\ninstructed to mount guard over Tom. \"He\\'s tied so tight he can\\'t\\n\\nmove. I want to hear what you say.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Very well then,\" assented the leader,  \"But look to his\\n\\nbonds.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe lad made a hasty examination of the ropes binding the young\\n\\ninventor to the tree, and Tom was glad that the examination was a\\n\\nhasty one. For he feared the guard might discover that one hand\\n\\nhad been worked nearly free. The young inventor had done this\\n\\nwhile he leered at his captors.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom was not going to submit tamely to the nonsense, and from\\n\\nthe moment he had been tied, he had been trying to get loose. He\\n\\nhad nearly succeeded in freeing one hand when the crowd of masked\\n\\nboys moved off to one side, where they presently began to talk in\\n\\nexcited whispers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I wonder how they came to catch me,\" thought the prisoner, as\\n\\nhe worked feverishly to further loosen the ropes. \"This looks as\\n\\nif it was a put-up job, with the masks, and everything.\"  Later\\n\\nhe learned that the idea was the outcome of a proposal of one of\\n\\nthe new arrivals in town. He had organized the \"Deep Forest\\n\\nThrong,\" as a sort of secret society, and Andy and his cronies\\n\\nhad been induced to join. It was Andy\\'s proposal to capture Tom,\\n\\nthough, and, having seen him depart for Mansburg on his motor-\\n\\ncycle, and knowing that he would return along a road that ran\\n\\nnear the woods where the Throng met, suggested that they take Tom\\n\\ncaptive. The idea was enthusiastically received, and Andy and his\\n\\ncronies thought they saw a chance to be revenged.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom, while he picked at the ropes, listened to what the boys\\n\\nwere saying. He heard frequent mention of tar and feathers, and\\n\\nbegan to believe, that unless he could get free, while they were\\n\\noff there consulting, he might be forced to submit to the\\n\\nhumiliating ordeal.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe managed to get one hand comparatively free, so that he could\\n\\nmove it about, but then he struck several hard knots, and could\\n\\nmake no further progress. The conference seemed on the point of\\n\\nbreaking up.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"One of you go for a big kettle to boil the tar in,\" ordered\\n\\nthe leader, \"and the rest of you dig up some feathers.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I must get loose!\" thought Tom desperately. \"If they try to\\n\\ntar and feather me it will be a risky business. I\\'ve got to get\\n\\nloose! They may burn me severely!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut, though he tried with all his strength, the ropes would not\\n\\nloosen another bit. He had one hand free, and that was all. The\\n\\ncrowd was moving back toward him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"My knife!\" thought the captive quickly. \"If I can reach that\\n\\nin my pocket I can cut the ropes! Once I get loose I\\'ll fight the\\n\\nwhole crowd!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe managed to get his free hand into his pocket. His fingers\\n\\ntouched something. It was not his knife, and, for a moment he\\n\\nfelt a pang of disappointment. Then, as he realized what it was\\n\\nthat he had grasped, a new idea came to him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"This will be better than the knife!\" he thought exultantly.\\n\\nThe crowd of lads was now surrounding him, some distance from the\\n\\nfire, which burned in front of the captive.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Sentence has been passed upon you,\" remarked the leader.\\n\\n\"Prepare to meet thy doom! Get the materials, brothers!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"One moment!\" called Tom, for he wanted the crowd all present\\n\\nto witness what he was about to do. \"I\\'ll give you one chance to\\n\\nlet me go peaceably. If you don\\'t--\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, what will you do?\" demanded Andy sneeringly, as he\\n\\npulled his mask further over his face. \"I guess you won\\'t do\\n\\nanything, Tom Swift.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll give you one chance to let me go, and I\\'ll agree to say\\n\\nnothing about this joke,\" went on Tom. \"If you don\\'t I\\'ll blow\\n\\nthis place up!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a moment there was a silence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ha! Ha! Ho! Ho!\" laughed Sam Snedecker. \"Listen to him! He\\'ll\\n\\nblow the place up! I\\'d like to see you do it! You can\\'t get loose\\n\\nin the first place, and you haven\\'t anything to blow it up with\\n\\nin the second. I\\'d like to see you do it; hey, fellers?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Sure,\" came the answering chorus.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Would you?\" asked Tom quickly. \"Then watch. Stand back if you\\n\\ndon\\'t want to get hurt, and remember that I gave you a chance to\\n\\nlet me go!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom made a rapid motion with the hand he had gotten loose. He\\n\\nthrew something to ward the blazing fire, which was now burning\\n\\nwell. Something white sailed through the air, and fell amid the\\n\\nhot embers.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a moment\\'s pause, and then a blinding flash of blue\\n\\nfire lighted up the woods, and a dull rumble, as when gun-powder\\n\\nis lighted in the open followed. A great cloud of white smoke\\n\\narose, as the vivid blue glare died away, and it seemed as if a\\n\\ngreat wind swept over the place. Several of the masked lads were\\n\\nknocked down by the explosion, and when the rumble died away, and\\n\\ndeep blackness succeeded the intense blue light, there came cries\\n\\nof pain and terror. The fire had been scattered, and extinguished\\n\\nby the explosion which Tom, though still bound to the tree had\\n\\ncaused to happen in the midst of the Deep Forest Throng. Then, as\\n\\nthe smoke rolled away, Andy Foger cried:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Come on, fellows! Something\\'s happened. I guess a volcano blew\\n\\nup!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX              TOM IS RESCUED\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Deep Forest Throng needed no urging to flee from the place\\n\\nof the mysterious explosion. Their prisoner, helpless as he had\\n\\nseemed, had proved too much for them. Slipping and stumbling\\n\\nalong in the darkness, the masked lads had but one thought--to\\n\\nget away before they saw more of that blue fire, and the force of\\n\\nthe concussion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Gee! My eyebrows are all singed off!\" cried Sam Snedecker, as\\n\\nhe tore loose his mask which had been rent in the explosion, and\\n\\nfelt of his face.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And my hands are burned,\" added Pete Bailey. \"I stood closer\\n\\nto the fire than any of you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You did not! I got the worst of it!\" cried Andy. \"I was\\n\\nknocked down by the explosion, and I\\'ll bet I\\'m hurt somewhere. I\\n\\nguess--Oh! Help! I\\'m falling in a mud hole!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a splash, and the bully disappeared from the sight of\\n\\nhis companions who, now that the moon had risen, could better see\\n\\nto flee from their prisoner.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Help me out, somebody!\" pleaded Andy. \"I\\'m in a mud hole!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThey pulled him out, a sorry looking sight, and the red-haired\\n\\nlad, whose locks were now black with muck, began to lament his\\n\\nlot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Dry up!\" commanded Sid Holton. \"It\\'s all your fault, for\\n\\nproposing such a fool trick as capturing Tom Swift. We might have\\n\\nknown he would get the best of us.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What was that stuff he used, anyhow?\" asked Cecil Hedden, the\\n\\nlad responsible for the organization of the Deep Forest Throng.\\n\\n\"He must be a wonder. Does he do sleight-of-hand tricks?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He does all sorts of tricks,\" replied Pete Bailey, feeling of\\n\\na big lump on his head, caused by falling on a stone in the mad\\n\\nrush. \"I guess we were chumps to tackle him. He must have put\\n\\nsome kind of chemical in the fire, to make it blow up.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Or else he summoned his airship by wireless, and had that\\n\\nballoonist, Mr. Sharp, drop a bomb in the blaze,\" suggested\\n\\nanother lad.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But how could he do anything? Wasn\\'t he tied fast to that\\n\\ntree?\" asked Cecil, the leader.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You never know when you\\'ve got Tom Swift tied,\" declared Jack\\n\\nReynolds. \"You think you\\'ve got him, and you haven\\'t. He\\'s too\\n\\nslick for us. It\\'s Andy\\'s fault, for proposing to capture him.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s right! Blame it all on me,\" whined the squint-eyed\\n\\nbully. \"You was just as anxious as I was to tar and feather him.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, we didn\\'t do it,\" commented Pete Bailey, dryly. \"I\\n\\ns\\'pose he\\'s loose now, laughin\\' at us. Gee, but that was an\\n\\nexplosion though! It\\'s a wonder some of us weren\\'t killed! I\\n\\nguess I\\'ve had enough of this Deep Forest Throng business. No\\n\\nmore for mine.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Aw, don\\'t be afraid,\" urged Cecil. \"The next time we get him\\n\\nwe\\'ll be on our guard.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'ll never catch Tom Swift again,\" predicted Pete.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll go back now to where he is, if you will,\" agreed Cecil,\\n\\nwho was older than the others.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not much!\" cried Pete. \"I\\'ve had enough.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThis seemed to be the sentiment of all. Away they stumbled\\n\\nthrough the woods, and, emerging on the road, scattered to their\\n\\nseveral homes, not one but who suffered from slight burns,\\n\\ncontusions, torn and muddy clothes or injured feelings as the\\n\\noutcome of the \"joke\" on the young inventor.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut our hero was not yet free from the bonds of his enemies.\\n\\nWhen they scattered and ran, after the vivid blue light, and the\\n\\ndull explosion, which, being unconfined, did no real damage, Tom\\n\\nwas still fast to the tree. As his eyes became accustomed to the\\n\\nsemi-darkness that followed the glare, he remarked:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know that I\\'m much better off. I gave those\\n\\nfellows a good scare, but I\\'m not loose. But I can work to better\\n\\nadvantage now.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce more he resumed the effort to free himself, but in spite\\n\\nof the crude manner in which the knots had been made, the lad\\n\\ncould not get loose. The more he pulled and tugged the tighter\\n\\nthey seemed to become.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"This is getting serious,\" Tom mused. \"If I could only reach my\\n\\nknife I could cut them, but it\\'s in my pocket on the other side,\\n\\nand that bond\\'s fast. Guess I\\'ll have to stay here all night.\\n\\nMaybe I\\'d better call for help, but--\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHis words, spoken half aloud, were suddenly interrupted by a\\n\\ncrash in the underbrush. Somebody was approaching. At first Tom\\n\\nthought it was Andy and his cronies coming back, but a voice that\\n\\ncalled a moment later proved that this was not so.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Is any one here?\" shouted a man. \"Any one hurt? What was that\\n\\nfire and explosion?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m here,\" replied Tom. \"I\\'m not hurt exactly, but I\\'m tied to\\n\\na tree. I\\'ll be much obliged if you\\'ll loosen me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Who are you?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Tom Swift. Is that you, Mr. Mason?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes. By jinks! I never expected to find you here, Tom. Over\\n\\nthis way, men,\" he added calling aloud. \"I\\'ve found him; it\\'s Tom\\n\\nSwift.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was the flicker of several lanterns amid the trees, and\\n\\nsoon a number of men had joined Mr. Mason, and surrounded Tom.\\n\\nThey were farmers living in the neighborhood.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What in the name o\\' Tunket happened?\" asked one. \"Did you get\\n\\nhit by a meteor or a comet? Who tied you up; highwaymen?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Cut him loose first, and ask questions afterward,\" suggested\\n\\nMr. Mason.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes,\" added Tom, with a laugh, \"I wish you would. I\\'m\\n\\nbeginning to feel cramped.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWith their knives, the farmers quickly cut the ropes, and some\\n\\nof them rubbed the arms of the lad to restore the circulation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What was it--highwaymen?\" asked a man, unable to longer\\n\\nrestrain his curiosity. \"Did they rob you?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, it wasn\\'t highwaymen,\" replied the youth. \"It was a trick\\n\\nof some boys I know,\" and to Tom\\'s credit be it said that he did\\n\\nnot mention their names. \"They did it for a joke,\" he added.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Boys\\' trick? Joke?\" queried Mr. Mason. \"Pretty queer sort of a\\n\\njoke, I think. They ought to be arrested.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, I fancy I gave them what was coming to them,\" went on the\\n\\nyoung inventor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Did they try to blow ye up, too?\" asked Mr. Hertford. \"What in\\n\\nth\\' name of Tunket was that blue light, and that explosion? I\\n\\nheard it an\\' saw it way over to my house.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So did I,\" remarked Mr. Mason, and several others said the\\n\\nsame thing. \"We thought a meteor had fallen,\" he continued, \"and\\n\\nwe got together to make an investigation.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s a good thing for me you did,\" admitted Tom, \"or I might\\n\\nhave had to stay here all night.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But was it a meteor?\" insisted Mr. Hertford.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No,\" replied the lad, \"I did it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes. You see after they tied me I found I could get one hand\\n\\nfree. I reached in my pocket for my knife, but instead of it I\\n\\nmanaged to get hold of a package of powder I had.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Gunpowder?\" asked Mr. Mason.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, a chemical powder I use in an electrical battery. The\\n\\npowder explodes in fire, and makes quite a blue flash, and a lot\\n\\nof smoke, but it isn\\'t very dangerous, otherwise I wouldn\\'t have\\n\\nused it. When the boys were some distance away from the fire, I\\n\\nthrew the powder in the blaze. It went off in a moment, and--\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I guess they run some; didn\\'t they?\" asked Mr. Mason with a\\n\\nlaugh.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They certainly did,\" agreed Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X               TOM HAS A FALL\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe young inventor told more details of his adventure in the\\n\\nwoods, but, though the farmers questioned him closely, he would\\n\\nnot give a single name of his assailants.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But I should think you\\'d want to have them punished,\" remarked\\n\\nMr. Mason.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll attend to that part later,\" answered Tom. \"Besides, most\\n\\nof them didn\\'t know what they were doing. They were led on by one\\n\\nor two. No, I\\'ll fight my own battles. But I wish you\\'d lend me a\\n\\nlantern long enough to find my motor-cycle. The moon doesn\\'t give\\n\\nmuch light in the woods, and those fellows may have hidden my\\n\\nmachine.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Mason and his companions readily agreed to accompany Tom on\\n\\na search for his wheel. It was found just where he had dismounted\\n\\nfrom it in the road. Andy and his cronies had evidently had\\n\\nenough of their encounter with our hero, and did not dare to\\n\\nannoy him further.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Do you think you can ride home?\" asked one of the farmers of\\n\\nthe lad, when he had ascertained that his machine was in running\\n\\norder.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s risky without my lantern,\" answered Tom. \"They\\n\\nsmashed that for me. But I guess I can manage.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, you can\\'t!\" insisted Mr. Mason. \"You\\'re stiff from being\\n\\ntied up; and you can\\'t ride. Now you just wheel that contraption\\n\\nover to my place, and I\\'ll hitch up and take you home. It isn\\'t\\n\\nfar.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, I couldn\\'t think of troubling you,\" declared Tom. At the\\n\\nsame time he felt that he was in no condition to ride.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s no trouble at all,\" insisted Mr. Mason. \"I guess your\\n\\nfather and I are good enough friends to allow me to have my way.\\n\\nYou can come over and get your choo-choo bicycle in the morning.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nA little later Tom was being rapidly driven toward his home,\\n\\nwhere he found his father and Mrs. Baggert, to say nothing of Mr.\\n\\nSharp, somewhat alarmed over his absence, as it was getting late.\\n\\nThe youth told as much of his adventure as he thought would not\\n\\nalarm his father, making a sort of joke of it, and, later,\\n\\nrelated all the details to the balloonist.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We\\'ll have to get after Andy again,\" declared the aeronaut.\\n\\n\"He needs another toning down.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, similar to the one he got when we nearly ran away with\\n\\nhis automobile, by catching the airship anchor on it,\" added Tom\\n\\nwith a laugh. \"But I fancy Andy will steer clear of me for a\\n\\nwhile. I\\'m sorry I had to use up that chemical powder, though.\\n\\nNow I can\\'t start my battery until to-morrow.\" But the next day\\n\\nTom made up for lost time, by working from early until late. He\\n\\nwent over to Mr. Mason\\'s, got his motor-cycle, procured some more\\n\\nof the chemical, and soon had his storage battery in running\\n\\norder. Then he arranged for a more severe test, and while that\\n\\nwas going on he worked at completing the body of the electric\\n\\nrunabout. The vehicle was beginning to look like a car, though it\\n\\nwas not of the regulation pattern.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the next week Tom was very busy, so occupied, in fact, that\\n\\nhe scarcely took time for his meals, which caused Mrs. Baggert no\\n\\nlittle worriment, for she was a housekeeper who liked to see\\n\\nothers enjoy her cooking.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, Tom, how are you coming on?\" asked his father one night,\\n\\nas they sat on the porch, Mr. Sharp with them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Pretty well, Dad,\" was the answer of the young inventor. \"I\\'ll\\n\\nput the wheels on tomorrow, and then set the batteries. I\\'ve got\\n\\nthe motor all finished; and all I\\'ll have to do will be to\\n\\nconnect it up, and then I\\'ll be ready for a trial on the road.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And you still think you\\'ll beat all records?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m pretty sure of it, Dad. You see the amperage will be\\n\\nexceptionally high, and my batteries will have a large amount of\\n\\nreserve, with little internal resistance. But do you know I\\'m so\\n\\ntired I can hardly think. It\\'s more of a job than I thought it\\n\\nwould be.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom, a little later, strolled down the road. As he turned back\\n\\ntoward the house and walked up the shrubbery lined path he heard\\n\\na noise.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Some one\\'s hiding in there!\" thought the lad, and he darted to\\n\\nan opening in the hedge to reach the other side. As he did so he\\n\\nsaw a figure running away. Whether it was a man or a boy he could\\n\\nnot tell in the darkness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hold on there!\" cried the young inventor, but, naturally, the\\n\\nfleeing one did not stop. Tom began to sprint, and as it was\\n\\nslightly down hill, he made good time. The figure ahead of him\\n\\nwas running well, too, but Tom who could see better, now that he\\n\\nwas out from under the trees, noticed that he was gaining. The\\n\\nfleeing one came to a little brook, and hesitated a moment before\\n\\nleaping across. This enabled Tom to catch up, and he made a grab\\n\\nfor the figure, just as the man or boy sprang across the little\\n\\nstream.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom missed his grip, but he was not going to give up. He\\n\\nscarcely slackened his speed, but, with the momentum he had\\n\\nacquired in racing down the hill, he, too, leaped across the\\n\\nbrook. As he landed on the other side he made another grab for\\n\\nthe figure, a man, as Tom could now see, but he could make out no\\n\\nfeatures, as the person\\'s hat was pulled down over his face.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got you now!\" cried Tom exultantly, reaching out his\\n\\nhand. His fingers clutched something, but the next instant the\\n\\nyoung inventor went sprawling. The other had put out his foot,\\n\\nand tripped him neatly and, Tom throwing out his hands to save\\n\\nhimself in the fall that was inevitable, went splashing into the\\n\\nbrook at full length. The unknown, pausing a moment to view what\\n\\nhe had done, turned quickly and raced off in the darkness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI              CROSSED WIRES\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore surprised than hurt, and with a feeling of chagrin and\\n\\nanger at the trick which had been played on him, Tom managed to\\n\\nscramble out of the brook. The water was not deep, but he had\\n\\nsplashed in with such force that he was wet all over. And, as he\\n\\ngot up, the water drip-ping from his clothes, the lad was\\n\\nconscious of a pain in his head. He put up his hand, and found\\n\\nthat contact with a stone had raised a large lump on his\\n\\nforehead. It was as big as a hen\\'s egg.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Humph! I\\'ll be a pretty sight to-morrow,\" murmured Tom. \"I\\n\\nwonder who that fellow was, anyhow, and what he wanted? He\\n\\ntripped me neatly enough, whoever he was. I\\'ve a good notion to\\n\\nkeep on after him.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen, as he realized what a start the fleeing one had, the\\n\\nyoung inventor knew that it would be fruitless to renew the\\n\\nchase. Slowly he ascended the sloping bank, and started for home.\\n\\nAs he did so he realized that he had, clasped in his fingers,\\n\\nsomething he had grabbed from the person he was pursuing just\\n\\nbefore his unlucky tumble.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s part of his watch chain!\" exclaimed Tom, as he felt of\\n\\nthe article. \"I must have ripped it loose when I fell. Wonder\\n\\nwhat it is? Evidently some sort of a charm. Maybe it will be a\\n\\nclue.\"  He tried to discern of what style it was, but in the dark\\n\\nwoods this was impossible. Then the lad tried to strike a match,\\n\\nbut those in his pocket had become wet from his unexpected bath.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll have to wait until I get home,\" he went on, and he hastened\\n\\nhis steps, for he was anxious to see what he had torn loose from\\n\\nthe person who appeared to be spying on him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why Tom, what\\'s the matter?\" exclaimed Mrs. Baggert, when he\\n\\nentered the kitchen, dripping water at every step. \"Is it raining\\n\\noutside? I didn\\'t hear any storm.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It was raining where I was,\" replied Tom angrily. \"I fell in\\n\\nthe brook. It was so hot I thought I\\'d cool off.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"With your best suit on!\" ejaculated the housekeeper.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It isn\\'t my best,\" retorted the lad. \"But I went in before I\\n\\nthought. It was an accident; I fell,\" he added, lest Mrs. Baggert\\n\\ntake his joking remarks seriously. He did not want to tell her of\\n\\nthe chase.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe chief concern of the lad now was to look at the charm and,\\n\\nas soon as Mrs. Baggert\\'s attention was attracted elsewhere, Tom\\n\\nglanced at the object he still held tightly clenched in his hand.\\n\\nAs the light from the kitchen fell upon it he could hardly\\n\\nrepress an exclamation of astonishment.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the charm that he held in his hand was one he had seen\\n\\nbefore dangling from the watch chain of Addison Berg, the agent\\n\\nfor Bentley & Eagert, submarine boat builders, which firm had, as\\n\\ntold in \"Tom Swift and His Submarine,\" tried unsuccessfully to\\n\\nsecure the gold treasure from the sunken wreck. Berg and his\\n\\nassociates had even gone so far as to try to disable the Advance,\\n\\nthe boat of Tom and his father, by ramming her when deep down\\n\\nunder the ocean, but Mr. Swift\\'s use of an electric cannon had\\n\\nbroken the steering gear of the Wonder, the rival craft, and from\\n\\nthat time on Tom and his friends had a clear field to search for\\n\\nthe bullion held fast in the hold of the Boldero. \"Addison Berg,\"\\n\\nmurmured Tom, as he looked at the watch charm. \"What can he be\\n\\ndoing in this neighborhood? Hiding, too, as if he wanted to\\n\\noverhear something. That\\'s the way he did when we were building\\n\\nour submarine, and now he\\'s up to the same trick when I\\'m\\n\\nconstructing my electric car. I\\'m sure this charm is his. It is\\n\\nsuch a peculiar design that I\\'m positive I can\\'t be mistaken. I\\n\\nthought, when I was chasing after him, that it would turn out to\\n\\nbe Andy Foger, or some of the boys, but it was too big for them.\\n\\nAddison Berg, eh? What can he be doing around here? I must not\\n\\ntell Dad, or he\\'d worry himself sick. But I must be on my guard.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom examined the charm closely. It was a compass, but made in\\n\\nan odd form, and was much ornamented.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe young inventor had noticed it on several occasions when he\\n\\nhad been in conversation with Mr. Berg previous to the attempt on\\n\\nthe part of the owners of the rival submarine to wreck Tom\\'s\\n\\nboat. He felt that he could not be mistaken in identifying the\\n\\ncharm.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Berg was afraid I\\'d catch him, and ask for an explanation that\\n\\nwould have been awkward to make,\" thought the lad, as he turned\\n\\nthe charm over in his hand. \"That\\'s why he tripped me up. But\\n\\nI\\'ll get at the bottom of this yet. Maybe he wants to steal my\\n\\nideas for an electric car.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom\\'s musings were suddenly interrupted by Mrs. Baggert.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I hope you\\'re not going to stand there all night,\" she said,\\n\\nwith a laugh. \"You\\'re in the middle of a puddle now, but when you\\n\\nget over dreaming I\\'d like to mop it up.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"All right,\" agreed the young inventor, coming to himself\\n\\nsuddenly. \"Guess I\\'d better go get some dry clothes on.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'d better go to bed,\" advised Mrs. Baggert. \"That\\'s where\\n\\nyour father and Mr. Sharp are. It\\'s late.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe more Tom thought over the strange occurrence the more it\\n\\npuzzled him. He mused over the presence of Berg as he went about\\n\\nhis work the next day, for that it was the agent whom he had\\n\\npursued he felt positive.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But I can\\'t figure out why he was hanging around here,\" mused\\n\\nTom.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen, as he found that his thoughts over the matter were\\n\\ninterfering with his work, he resolutely put them from him, and\\n\\nthrew himself energetically into the labor of completing his\\n\\nelectric car. The new batteries, he found, were working well, and\\n\\nin the next two days he had constructed several more, joining\\n\\nthem so as to get the combined effect.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was the afternoon of the third day from Tom\\'s unexpected\\n\\nfall into the brook that the young inventor decided on the first\\n\\nimportant test of his new device. He was going to try the motor,\\n\\nrunning it with his storage battery. Some of the connections were\\n\\nalready in place, the wires being fastened to the side of the\\n\\nshop, where they were attached to switches. Tom did not go over\\n\\nthese, taking it for granted that they were all right. He soon\\n\\nhad the motor, which he was to install in his car, wired to the\\n\\nbattery, and then he attached a gauge, to ascertain, by\\n\\ncomparison, how many miles he could hope to travel on one\\n\\ncharging of the storage battery.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Guess I\\'ll call Dad and Mr. Sharp in to see how it works,\\n\\nbefore I turn on the current,\" he said to himself. He was about\\n\\nto summon his parent and the aeronaut from an adjoining shop,\\n\\nwhere they were working over a new form of dynamo, when the lad\\n\\ncaught sight of the watch charm he had left on his desk, in plain\\n\\nsight.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Better put that away,\" he remarked. \"Dad or Mr. Sharp might\\n\\nsee it, and ask questions. Then I\\'d have to explain, and I don\\'t\\n\\nwant to, not until I get further toward the bottom of this\\n\\nthing.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe put the charm away, and then summoned his father and the\\n\\nballoonist.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'re going to see a fine experiment,\" declared Tom. \"I\\'m\\n\\ngoing to turn on the full strength of my battery.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Are you sure it\\'s all right, Tom?\" asked his father. \"You\\n\\ncan\\'t be too careful when you\\'re dealing with electricity of high\\n\\nvoltage, and great ampere strength.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s all right, Dad,\" his son assured him \"Now watch my\\n\\nmotor hum.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe walked over to a big copper switch, and grasped the black\\n\\nrubber handle to pull it over which would send the current from\\n\\nthe storage battery into the combination of wheels and gears that\\n\\nhe hoped, ultimately, would propel his electric automobile along\\n\\nthe highways, or on a track, at the rate of a hundred miles an\\n\\nhour.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Here she goes!\" cried Tom. For an instant he hesitated and\\n\\nthen pulled the switch. At the same time his hand rested on\\n\\nanother wire, stretched across a bench.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo sooner had the switch closed than there was a blinding\\n\\nflash, a report as of a gun being fired, and Tom\\'s body seemed to\\n\\nstraighten out. Then a blue flame appeared to encircle him and he\\n\\ndropped to the floor of the shop, an inert mass.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He\\'s killed!\" cried Mr. Swift, springing forward.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Careful!\" cautioned the balloonist. \"He\\'s been shocked! Don\\'t\\n\\ntouch him until I turn off the current!\"  As he pulled out the\\n\\nswitch, the aeronaut gave a glance at the apparatus.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There\\'s something wrong here!\" he cried. \"The wires have been\\n\\ncrossed! That\\'s what shocked Tom, but he never made the wrong\\n\\nconnections! He\\'s too good an electrician! There\\'s been some one\\n\\nin this shop, changing the wires!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII             THE TRY OUT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce the current was cut off it was safe to approach the body\\n\\nof the young inventor. Mr Sharp stooped over and lifted Tom\\'s\\n\\nform from the floor, for Mr. Swift was too excited and trembled\\n\\ntoo much to be of any service. Our hero was as one dead. His body\\n\\nwas limp, after that first rigid stretching out, as the current\\n\\nran through him; his eyes were closed, and his face was very\\n\\npale.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Is--is there any hope?\" faltered Mr. Swift.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I think so,\" replied the balloonist. \"He is still breathing-\\n\\nfaintly. We must summon a doctor at once. Will you telephone for\\n\\none, while I carry him in the house?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAs Mr. Sharp emerged from the shop, bearing Tom\\'s body, an\\n\\nautomobile drew up in front of the place.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my soul!\" exclaimed a voice. \"Tom\\'s hurt! How did it\\n\\nhappen? Bless my very existence!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, Mr. Damon, you\\'re just in time!\" exclaimed Mr. Sharp,\\n\\n\"Tom\\'s had a bad shock. Will you go for a doctor in your auto?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Better than that! Let me take Tom in the car to Dr.\\n\\nWhiteside\\'s office,\" proposed the eccentric man. \"It will be\\n\\nbetter that way.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, yes,\" agreed Mr. Swift eagerly. \"Put Tom in the auto!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If only it doesn\\'t break down,\" added Mr. Damon fervently.\\n\\n\"Bless my spark plug, but it would be just my luck!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut they started off all right, Mr. Swift riding in front with\\n\\nMr. Damon, and Mr. Sharp supporting Tom in the tonneau. Only a\\n\\nlittle fluttering of the eyelids, and a slow, faint breathing\\n\\ntold that Tom Swift still lived.\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Damon never guided a car better than he did his auto that\\n\\nday. Several speed laws were broken, but no one appeared to stop\\n\\nthem, and, in record time they had the young inventor at the\\n\\nphysician\\'s house. Fortunately Dr. Whiteside was at home, and,\\n\\nunder his skillful treatment Tom was soon out of danger. His\\n\\nheart action was properly started, and then it was only a\\n\\nquestion of time. As the doctor had plenty of room it was decided\\n\\nto let the lad remain that night, and Tom was soon installed in a\\n\\nspare bedroom, with the doctor\\'s pretty daughter to wait on him\\n\\noccasionally.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'m all right,\" the youth insisted, when Miss Whiteside\\n\\ntold him it was time for his medicine. \"I\\'m all right.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'re not!\" she declared. \"I ought to know, for I\\'m going to\\n\\nbe a nurse, some day, and help papa. Now take this or I\\'ll have\\n\\nto hold your nose, as they do the baby\\'s,\" and she held out a\\n\\nspoonful of unpleasant looking mixture, extending her dainty\\n\\nforefinger and thumb of her other hand, as if to administer dire\\n\\npunishment to Tom, if he did not obey.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I give in to superior strength,\" he said with a laugh,\\n\\nas he noted, with approval, the laughing face of his nurse.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen he fell into a deep sleep, and was so much better the next\\n\\nmorning that he could be taken home in Mr. Damon\\'s auto.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But mind, no hard work for three or four days,\" insisted the\\n\\nphysician. \"I want your heart to get in shape for that big race\\n\\nyou were telling me about. The shock was a severe strain to it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom promised, reluctantly, and, though he did no work, his\\n\\nfirst act, on reaching home, was to go out to the shop, to\\n\\ninspect the battery and motor. To his surprise the motor was\\n\\nrunning for the lad had established the connection, in spite of\\n\\nhis shock and his father and Mr. Sharp had decided to let the\\n\\nmachinery run until he came back.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And look at the record it\\'s made!\" cried Tom delightedly as he\\n\\nglanced at the gauge \"Better than I figured on. That battery is a\\n\\nwonder. I\\'ll have the fastest electric runabout you ever saw.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If the wires don\\'t get crossed again,\" put in Mr. Sharp.\\n\\n\"You\\'d better make an examination, Tom,\" and, for the first time,\\n\\nthe young inventor learned how he had been shocked.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Crossed wires! I should say they were crossed!\" he exclaimed\\n\\nas he looked at the switches and copper conductors. \"Somebody has\\n\\nbeen tampering with them. No wonder I was shocked!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Who did it?\" asked Mr. Sharp.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom considered for a moment, before answering. Then he said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I believe it was Addison Berg. He must have wanted to do some\\n\\ndamage, to get even with us for getting that treasure away from\\n\\nhim.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Berg?\" questioned the balloonist, and Tom told of the night he\\n\\nhad been tripped into the brook, and exhibited the watch charm he\\n\\nhad secured. Mr. Sharp recognized it at once. A further\\n\\nexamination confirmed the belief that the submarine agent had\\n\\nsneaked into Tom\\'s workshop, and had altered the wires.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They were all right when I came out of the shop that night,\"\\n\\ndeclared Tom. \"I left the old connections just as I thought I had\\n\\narranged them, and only added the new ones, when I went to try my\\n\\nbattery. The old connections were crossed, but I didn\\'t notice\\n\\nit. Then when I turned on the current I got the shock. I don\\'t\\n\\ns\\'pose Berg thought I\\'d be so nearly killed. Probably he wanted\\n\\nto burn out my motor, and spoil it. If it was Andy Foger I could\\n\\nunderstand it, but a man like Berg--\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He\\'s probably wild with anger because his submarine got the\\n\\nworst of it in the race for the gold,\" interrupted the\\n\\nballoonist. \"Well, we\\'ll have to be on our guard, that\\'s all.\\n\\nWhat was the matter with Eradicate, that he didn\\'t see him enter\\n\\nthe shop?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Rad went to a colored dance that night,\" said Tom. \"I let him\\n\\noff. But after this I\\'ll have the shop guarded night and day. My\\n\\nmotor might have been ruined, if that first charge hadn\\'t gone\\n\\nthrough my body instead of into the machinery.\"  The improper\\n\\nconnections were soon removed and others substituted.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was agreed between Tom and Mr. Sharp that they would say\\n\\nnothing regarding Mr. Berg to Mr. Swift. The aeronaut caused\\n\\ncautious inquiries to be made, and learned that the agent had\\n\\nbeen discharged by the submarine firm, because of some wrong-\\n\\ndoing in connection with the craft Wonder, and it was surmised\\n\\nthat the agent believed Tom to be at the bottom of his troubles.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a few days the young inventor was himself again, and as\\n\\nfurther trials of his battery showed it to be even better than\\n\\nits owner hoped, arrangements were made for testing it in the car\\n\\non the road.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe runabout was nearly finished, but it lacked a coat of\\n\\nvarnish, and some minor details, when Tom, assisted by his\\n\\nfather, Mr Sharp and Mr. Jackson, one morning, about a week\\n\\nlater, installed the motor and battery units. It did not take\\n\\nlong to gear up the machinery, connect the battery and, though\\n\\nthe car was rather a crude looking affair, Tom decided to give it\\n\\na try-out\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Want to come along, Dad?\" he asked, as he tightened up some\\n\\nbinding posts, and looked to see that the steering wheel,\\n\\nstarting and reverse levers worked properly, and that the side\\n\\nchains were well lubricated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not the first time,\" replied his father. \"Let\\'s see how it\\n\\nruns with you, first.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, I want some sort of a load in it,\" went on the lad. \"It\\n\\nwon\\'t be a good test unless I have a couple of others besides\\n\\nmyself. How about you, Mr. Damon?\" for the old gentleman was\\n\\nspending a few days at the Swift homestead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my shoe buttons! I\\'ll come!\" was the ready answer.\\n\\n\"After the experience I\\'ve been through in the airship and\\n\\nsubmarine, nothing can scare me. Lead on, I\\'ll follow!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t suppose you\\'ll hang back after that; will you, Mr.\\n\\nSharp?\" asked the lad, with a laugh.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t dare to, for the sake of my reputation,\" was the\\n\\nreply, for the balloonist who had made many ascensions, and\\n\\ndropped thousands of feet in parachutes, was naturally a brave\\n\\nman.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo he and Mr. Damon climbed into the rear seats of the odd-\\n\\nlooking electric car, while Tom took his place at the steering\\n\\nwheel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Are you all ready?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Let her go!\" fired back Mr. Sharp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my galvanometer, don\\'t go too fast on the start,\"\\n\\ncautioned Mr. Damon, nervously.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll not,\" agreed the young inventor. \"I want to get it warmed\\n\\nup before I try any speeding.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe turned on the current. There was a low, humming purr, which\\n\\ngradually increased to a whine, and the car moved slowly forward.\\n\\nIt rolled along the gravel driveway to the road, Tom listening to\\n\\nevery sound of the machinery, as a mother listens to the\\n\\nbreathing of a child.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"She\\'s moving!\" he cried.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But not much faster than a wheelbarrow,\" said his father, who\\n\\nsometimes teased his son.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Wait!\" cried the youth.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom turned more current into the motor. The purring and humming\\n\\nincreased, and the car seemed to leap forward. It was in the road\\n\\nnow, and, once assured that the steering apparatus was working\\n\\nwell, Tom suddenly turned on much more speed.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo quickly did the electric auto shoot forward that Mr. Damon\\n\\nand Mr. Sharp were jerked back against the cushions of the rear\\n\\nseats.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Here! What are you doing?\" inquired Mr. Sharp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m going to show you a little speed,\" answered Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe car was now moving rapidly, and there was a smoothness and\\n\\nlightness to its progress that was absent from a gasolene auto.\\n\\nThere was no vibration from the motor. Faster and faster it ran,\\n\\nuntil it was moving at a speed scarcely less than that of Mr.\\n\\nDamon\\'s car, when it was doing its best. Of course that was not\\n\\nsaying much, for the car owned by the odd gentleman was not a\\n\\nvery powerful one, but it could make fast time occasionally.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Is this the best you can do?\" asked Mr. Damon. \"Not that it\\n\\nisn\\'t fast,\" he hastened to add, \"and I was wondering if it was\\n\\nyour limit.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not half!\" cried Tom, as he turned on a little more power.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not trying for a record to-day. I just want to see how the\\n\\nbattery and motor behaves.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Pretty well, I should say,\" commented Mr. Sharp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m satisfied--so far,\" agreed the lad.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey were now moving along the highway at a good speed--moving\\n\\nalmost silently, too, for the motor, save for a low hum, made no\\n\\nnoise. So quiet was the car, in fact, that it was nearly the\\n\\ncause of a disaster. Tom was so interested in the performance of\\n\\nhis latest invention, that, before he knew it, he had come up\\n\\nbehind a farmer, driving a team of skittish horses. As the big\\n\\nmachine went past them, giving no warning of its approach, the\\n\\nsteeds reared up, and would have bolted, but for the prompt\\n\\naction of the driver.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hey!\" he cried, angrily, as Tom speeded past, \"don\\'t you know\\n\\nyou got to give warnin\\' when you\\'re comin\\' with one of them ther\\n\\ngol-swizzled things! By Jehossephat I\\'ll have th\\' law on ye ef ye\\n\\ndo thet ag\\'in!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I forgot to ring the bell,\" apologized Tom, as he sent out a\\n\\npeal from the gong, and then, he let out a few more amperes, and\\n\\nthe speed increased.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hold on! I guess this is fast enough!\" cried Mr. Damon, as his\\n\\nhat blew off.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Fast?\" answered Tom. \"This is nothing to what I\\'ll do when I\\n\\nuse the full power. Then I\\'ll--\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was interrupted by a sharp report, and a vivid flash of fire\\n\\non a switch board near the steering wheel. The motor gave a sort\\n\\nof groan, and stopped, the car rolling on a little way, and then\\n\\nbecoming stationary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my collar button!\" ejaculated Mr. Damon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" inquired Mr. Sharp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Some sort of a blow-out,\" answered Tom ruefully, as he shoved\\n\\nthe starting handle over, trying to move the car. But it would\\n\\nnot budge. The new auto had \"gone dead\" on her first tryout. The\\n\\nyoung inventor was grievously disappointed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII            TOWED BY A MULE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my gizzard! Is it anything serious?\" asked Mr. Damon.\\n\\n\"Will it blow up, or anything like that?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No,\" replied the lad, as he leaped out of the car, and began\\n\\nto make an examination. Mr. Sharp assisted him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The motor seems to be all right,\" remarked the balloonist, as\\n\\nhe inspected it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes,\" agreed our hero, \"and the batteries have plenty of power\\n\\nleft in them yet. The gauge shows that. I can\\'t understand what\\n\\nthe trouble can be, unless--\" He paused in his remark and uttered\\n\\nan exclamation. \"I\\'ve found it!\" he cried.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What?\" demanded the aeronaut.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Some of the fuses blew out. I turned on too much current, and\\n\\nthe fuses wouldn\\'t carry it. I put them in to save the motor from\\n\\nbeing burned out, but I didn\\'t use heavy enough ones. I see where\\n\\nmy mistake was.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But what does it mean?\" inquired Mr. Damon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It means that we\\'ve got to walk back home,\" was Tom\\'s\\n\\nsorrowful answer. \"The car is stalled, for I haven\\'t any extra\\n\\nfuses with me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Can\\'t you connect up the battery by using some extra wire?\"\\n\\nasked Mr. Sharp. \"I have some,\" and he drew a coil of it from his\\n\\npocket.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t dare to. It might be so heavy that it would carry\\n\\nmore current than the motor could stand. I don\\'t want to burn\\n\\nthat out. No, I guess we\\'ll have to walk home, or rather I will.\\n\\nYou two can stay here until I come back with heavier fuses. I\\'m\\n\\nsorry.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom had hardly ceased speaking, when, from around the turn in\\n\\nthe road proceeded a voice, and, at the sound of it all three\\n\\nstarted, for the voice was saying:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Now it ain\\'t no use fer yo\\' to act dat-a-way, Boomerang. Yo\\'\\n\\nall ain\\'t got no call t\\' git contrary now, jest when I wants t\\'\\n\\ngit home t\\' mah dinner. I should t\\'ink you\\'d want t\\' git t\\' de\\n\\nstable, too. But ef yo\\' all ain\\'t mighty keerful I\\'ll cut down\\n\\nyo\\' rations, dat\\'s what I\\'se goin\\' to do. G\\'lang, now, dat\\'s a\\n\\ngood feller. Ho! Ho! I knowed dat\\'d fetch yo\\' all. When yo\\' all\\n\\nwiggles yo\\' ears dat-a-way, dat\\'s a suah sign yo\\' all is gwine t\\'\\n\\nmove.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen followed the sound of a rattletrap of a wagon approaching.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Eradicate! It\\'s Eradicate!\" exclaimed Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And his mule, Boomerang!\" added Mr. Sharp. \"He\\'s just in\\n\\ntime!\" commented Mr. Damon with a sigh of relief, as the ancient\\n\\noutfit, in charge of the aged colored man, came along. Eradicate\\n\\nhad been sent to Shopton to get a load of wood for Mr. Swift, and\\n\\nwas now returning. At the sight of the stalled auto the mule\\n\\npricked up his long ears, and threw them forward.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Whoa dar, now, Boomerang!\" cried Eradicate. \"Doan\\'t yo\\' all\\n\\ncommence t\\' gittin\\' skittish. Dat machine ain\\'t gwine t\\' hurt\\n\\nyo\\'. Why good  land a\\' massy! Ef \\'tain\\'t Mistah Swift!\" cried the\\n\\ncolored man, as he caught sight of Tom. \"What\\'s de trouble?\" he\\n\\nasked.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Broke down,\" answered the young inventor briefly. \"You always\\n\\nseem to come along when I\\'m in trouble, Rad.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Dat\\'s right,\" assented the darkey, with a grin. \"Me an\\'\\n\\ntrouble am ole acquaintances. Sometimes she hits me a clip on de\\n\\nhaid, den, ag\\'in Boomerang, mah mule, gits it. He jest had his\\n\\ntrouble. Got a stone under his shoe, an\\' didn\\'t want t\\' move. Den\\n\\nwhen I did git him started he balked on me. But I\\'se all right\\n\\nnow. But I suah am sorry fo\\' you. Can\\'t I help yo\\' all, Mistah\\n\\nSwift?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, you can, Rad,\" answered Tom. \"Drive home as fast as you\\n\\ncan, and ask Dad to send back with you some of those fuses he\\'ll\\n\\nfind on my work bench. He knows what I want. Hurry there and\\n\\nhurry back.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nEradicate shook his head doubtfully.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter? Don\\'t you want to go?\" asked Mr. Sharp, a\\n\\ntrifle nettled. \"We can\\'t get the car started until we have some\\n\\nnew fuses..\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, I wants t\\' go all right \\'nuff, Mistah Sharp,\" was\\n\\nEradicate\\'s prompt answer. \"Yo\\' all knows I\\'d do anyt\\'ing t\\'\\n\\n\\'blige yo\\' or Mistah Swift. But hits dish yeah mule, Boomerang. I\\n\\njest done promised him dat we were gwine home t\\' dinnah, an\\' he\\n\\n\\'spects a manger full ob oats. Ef I got to Mistah Swift\\'s house\\n\\nwid him, I couldn\\'t no mo\\' git him t\\' come back widout his\\n\\ndinnah, dan yo\\' all kin git dat \\'ar car t\\' move widout dem fusin\\'\\n\\nt\\'ings yo\\' all talked about.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my necktie!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"That\\'s all nonsense!\\n\\nYou don\\'t suppose that mule understands what you say to him, do\\n\\nyou? How does he know you promised him his dinner?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I doan\\'t know how he know, Mistah Damon,\" replied Eradicate,\\n\\n\"but he do know, jest de same. I know hit would be laik pullin\\'\\n\\nteeth an\\' wuss too, t\\' git Boomerang t\\' start back wid dem foosd\\n\\nt\\'ings until after he\\'s had his dinner. Wouldn\\'t it, Boomerang?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe mule waved his long ears as if in answer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my soul, I believe he does understand!\" cried Mr. Damon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Of course he do,\" put in the colored man. \"I\\'se awful sorry.\\n\\nNow if it were afternoon I could bring back dem what-d\\'ye-call-\\n\\n\\'ems in a jiffy, \\'cause Boomerang allers feels good arter he has\\n\\nhis dinnah, but befo\\' dat--\" and Eradicate shook his head, as if\\n\\nthere was no more to be said on the subject.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" remarked Tom, sadly, \"I guess there\\'s no help for it.\\n\\nWe\\'ll have to walk home, unless you two want to wait until I can\\n\\nride back with Eradicate, and come back on my motor cycle. Then\\n\\nI\\'ll have to leave the cycle here, for I can\\'t get it in the\\n\\ncar.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my collar button!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"It\\'s like the\\n\\npuzzle of the fox, the goose and the bag of corn on the banks of\\n\\na stream. I guess we\\'d better all walk.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hold on!\" exclaimed Mr. Sharp. \"Is your mule good and strong,\\n\\nEradicate?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Strong? Why dish yeah mule could pull a house ober--dat is\\n\\nwhen he\\'s got a mind to. An\\' he\\'d do most anyt\\'ing now, \\'ca\\'se\\n\\nhe\\'s anxious t\\' git home t\\' his dinnah; ain\\'t yo\\' all,\\n\\nBoomerang?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce more the mule waved his ears, like signal flags.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then I have a proposition to make,\" went on the balloonist.\\n\\n\"Unhitch the mule from the load of wood, and hitch him to the\\n\\nauto. We\\'ve got some rope along, I noticed. Then the mule can\\n\\npull us and the runabout home.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Good idea!\" cried Mr. Damon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Dat\\'s de racket!\" ejaculated Eradicate. \"I\\'ll jest\\n\\nsequesterate dish year load ob wood side ob de road, an\\' hitch\\n\\nBoomerang to de auto.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom said nothing for a few seconds.  He gazed sadly at his\\n\\nauto, which he hoped would win the touring club\\'s prize. It was a\\n\\nbitter pill for him to swallow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Towed by a mule!\" he exclaimed, shaking his head, and smiling\\n\\nruefully. \"The fastest car in this country towed by a mule! It\\'s\\n\\ntough luck!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Tain\\'t half so bad as goin\\' widout yo\\' dinnah, Mistah Swift!\"\\n\\nremarked Eradicate, as he began to harness the mule to the\\n\\nelectric runabout.\\n\\n\\n\\nBoomerang made no objection to the transfer. He looked around\\n\\nonce or twice as he was being made fast to the auto and, when the\\n\\nword was given he stepped out as if pulling home stalled cars was\\n\\nhis regular business. Tom sat beside Eradicate on the front seat,\\n\\nand steered, while the colored man drove the mule, and Mr. Sharp\\n\\nand Mr. Damon were in the \"tonneau\" seats as Tom called them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I hope no one sees us,\" thought Tom, but he was doomed to\\n\\ndisappointment. When nearly home he heard an auto approaching,\\n\\nand in it were Andy Foger, Sam Snedecker and Pete Bailey. The\\n\\nthree cronies stared at the odd sight of Boomerang ambling along,\\n\\nwith his great ears flapping, drawing Tom\\'s speedy new car.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ha! Ha!\" laughed Andy. \"So that\\'s the motive power he\\'s going\\n\\nto use! Look at him, fellows. I thought his new electric, that\\n\\nwas going to beat my car, and win the prize, was to be two\\n\\nhundred horse power. Instead it\\'s one mule power! That\\'s rich!\"\\n\\nand Andy\\'s chums joined in the laugh at poor Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe young imventor said nothing, for there was nothing he could\\n\\nsay. In dignified silence he passed the car containing his\\n\\nenemies, they, meanwhile, jeering at him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Dat\\'s all right,\" spoke Eradicate, sympathizing with his young\\n\\nemployer. \"Maybe dey\\'ll \\'want a tow derselves some day, an\\' when\\n\\ndey does, I\\'ll make Boomerang pull \\'em in a ditch.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut this was small comfort to Tom. He made up his mind, though,\\n\\nthat he would demonstrate that his car could do all that he had\\n\\nclaimed for it, and that very soon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV             A GREAT RUN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBoomerang did not belie the reputation Eradicate had given him\\n\\nas a beast of strength. Though the electric runabout was heavy,\\n\\nthe mule managed to move it along the road at a fair speed, with\\n\\nthe four occupants. Perhaps the animal knew that at the end of\\n\\nhis journey a good feed awaited him. At any rate they were soon\\n\\nwithin sight of the Swift home.\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Damon and Mr. Sharp refrained from making any comments that\\n\\nmight hurt Tom\\'s feelings, for they realized the chagrin felt by\\n\\nthe young inventor in having his apparatus go back on him at the\\n\\nfirst trial. But our hero was not the kind of a lad who is\\n\\ndisheartened by one failure, or even half a dozen.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe humor of the situation appealed to him, and, as he turned\\n\\nthe auto into the driveway, and noticed Boomerang\\'s long ears\\n\\nwaving to and fro, he laughed.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe lad insisted on putting new fuses in the car before he ate\\n\\nhis dinner, and then, satisfied that the motor was once more in\\n\\nrunning order, he partook of a hasty meal, and began making\\n\\nseveral changes which he had decided were desirable. He finished\\n\\nthem in time to go for a little run in the car all alone on a\\n\\nsecluded road late that afternoon.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom returned, with eyes shining, and cheeks flushed with\\n\\nelation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, how did it go? asked his father.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Fine! Better than I expected,\" responded his son\\n\\nenthusiastically. \"When it gets to running smoothly I\\'ll pass\\n\\nanything on the road.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be too sure,\" cautioned Mr. Swift, but Tom only smiled.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was still much to do on the electric runabout, and Tom\\n\\nspent the next few days in adjusting the light steel wind-shield,\\n\\nthat was to come down over the driver\\'s seat. He also put in a\\n\\npowerful electric search-light, which was run by current from the\\n\\nbattery, and installed a new speedometer and an instrument to\\n\\ntell how much current he was using, and how much longer the\\n\\nbattery would run without being exhausted. This was to enable him\\n\\nto know when to begin re-charging it. When the current was all\\n\\nconsumed it was necessary to store more in the battery. This\\n\\ncould be done by attaching wires from a dynamo, or, in an\\n\\nemergency by tapping an electric light wire in the street. But as\\n\\nthe battery would enable the car to run many miles on one\\n\\ncharging, Tom did not think he would ever have to resort to the\\n\\nemergency charging apparatus. He had a new system for this, one\\n\\nthat enabled him to do the work in much less than the usual time.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith his new car still unpainted, and rather rough and crude in\\n\\nappearance, the lad started out alone one morning, his father and\\n\\nMr. Sharp having declined to accompany him, on the plea of\\n\\nbusiness to attend to, and Mr. Damon not being at the Swift\\n\\nhouse.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom rode about for several hours, giving his car several severe\\n\\ntests in the way of going up hills, and speeding on the level. He\\n\\nwas proceeding along a quiet country road, in a small town about\\n\\nfifteen miles from Shopton, when, as he flashed past the small\\n\\nrailroad station, he saw a familiar figure standing on the\\n\\nplatform.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why, Ned!\" called Tom, \"what are you doing over here?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I might ask the same thing of you. Is that your new car? It\\n\\ndoesn\\'t look very new.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, this is it. I haven\\'t had a chance to paint and varnish\\n\\nit yet. But you ought to see it go. What are doing here, though?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I came over on some bank business. A customer here had some\\n\\nbonds he wanted to dispose of and I came for them. You see we\\'re\\n\\nenlarging our business since the new bank started.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Has it hurt your bank any?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not yet, but Foger and his associates are trying hard to make\\n\\nus lose money. Say, did you ever see such a place as this? I\\'ve\\n\\ngot to wait two hours for a train back to Shopton.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No you haven\\'t.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why not? Have they changed the timetable since I came over\\n\\nthis morning?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, but you can ride back with me.  I\\'m going, and I\\'ll show\\n\\nyou what my new electric car can do.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Good!\" cried the young bank cashier. \"You\\'re just in time. I\\n\\nwas wondering how I could kill two hours, but now I\\'ll get in\\n\\nyour new car and--\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And maybe we\\'ll kill a few chickens, or a dog or two when we\\n\\nget her speeded up,\" put in Tom, with a laugh in which Ned\\n\\njoined.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe two lads, seated in the front part of the auto, were soon\\n\\nmoving down the hard highway. Suddenly Tom pulled a lever and the\\n\\nsteel wind-shield came sliding down from the top case, meeting\\n\\nthe forward battery compartment, and forming a sort of slanting\\n\\nroof over the heads of the two occupants.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Here! What\\'s this?\" cried Ned.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We\\'re going to hit it up in a few minutes,\" replied the young\\n\\ninventor, \"and I want to reduce the wind resistance.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, I thought maybe we were going through a bombardment. It\\'s\\n\\nall right, go ahead, don\\'t mind me. I\\'m game.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a celluloid window in the steel wind-shield, and\\n\\nthrough this the lads could observe the road ahead of them.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs they swung along it, the speed increasing, Ned saw an auto\\n\\nahead of them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Whose car is that?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Don\\'t know,\" replied Tom. \"We\\'ll be up to it in about half a\\n\\nminute, though.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the electric runabout, more dilapidated looking than ever\\n\\nfrom the layer of dust that covered it, passed the other auto,\\n\\nwhich was a powerful car, the solitary occupant of it, a middle-\\n\\naged man, looked to one side, and, seeing the queer machine,\\n\\nremarked:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You fellows are going the wrong way to the junk heap. Turn\\n\\naround.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Is that so?\" asked Tom, his eyes flashing at the cheap wit of\\n\\nthe man. \"Why we came out here to show you the way!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Do you want to race?\" asked the man eagerly, too eagerly, Ned\\n\\nthought. \"I\\'ll give you a brush, if you do, and a handicap into\\n\\nthe bargain.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We don\\'t need it,\" replied the young inventor quickly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll wager fifty dollars I can beat you bad on this three-mile\\n\\nstretch,\" went on the autoist. \"How about it?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll race you, but I don\\'t bet,\" answered Tom, a bit stiffly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, be a sport,\" urged the man.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom shook his head. He had slowed down his machine, and was\\n\\nrunning even with the gasolene car now. He noticed that it was a\\n\\nnew one, of six cylinders, and looked speedy. Perhaps he was\\n\\nfoolish to pit his untried car against it. Yet he had confidence\\n\\nin his battery and motor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, we\\'ll race for the fun of it then,\" went on the man. \"Do\\n\\nyou want a handicap?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom shook his head again, and there came around his mouth a\\n\\ngrim look.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"All right,\" assented the other. \"Only you\\'re going to be beat\\n\\nbadly. I never saw an electric car yet that could do anything\\n\\nexcept to crawl along.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'re going to see one now,\" was all the retort Tom permitted\\n\\nhimself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Here we go then!\" cried the man, and he gave his gear handle a\\n\\nyank, and shoved over the sparking and gasolene levers.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis car instantly shot ahead, and went \"chug chugging\" down the\\n\\nroad in a cloud of dust. At the same moment Tom, in answer to a\\n\\nlook from Ned, who feared his friend was going to be left behind,\\n\\nturned more power into the motor. The humming, purring sound\\n\\nincreased and the electric car forged ahead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Can you catch him?\" asked Ned.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Watch,\" was all Tom said.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe hum of the motor became a sort of whine, and the electric\\n\\nrapidly acquired speed. It crept up on the gasolene car, as an\\n\\nexpress train overtakes a freight, and the man, looking back, and\\n\\nexpecting to see his rival far behind was surprised to note the\\n\\nqueer looking vehicle lapping his rear wheels.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, you are coming on, aren\\'t you?\" he asked. \"Maybe you\\'ll\\n\\nkeep up now!\" He shifted the gears, using a little more gasolene.\\n\\nFor a moment his car opened a wide gap between it and Tom\\'s, but\\n\\nthe young inventor had only begun to race. Still louder purred\\n\\nthe motor, and in a few minutes Tom was running on even terms\\n\\nwith his competitor. The man looked annoyed, and tried, by the\\n\\nskilful use of gasolene and sparking levers, to leave Tom behind.\\n\\nBut the electric held her own.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got to go the limit I see,\" remarked the man at last,\\n\\nglancing sideways at the other car. \"I\\'ll tell \\'em you\\'re\\n\\ncoming,\" he added, \"though I must say your electric does better\\n\\nthan any of its kind I ever came across.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m not done yet,\" was the comment of our hero. But the man\\n\\ndid not hear him, for he was yanking into place the lever that\\n\\nenabled him to run on direct drive for fourth speed.\\n\\n\\n\\nForward shot his car, and, for perhaps a quarter of a mile it\\n\\nled. The racers were almost at the end of the three-mile level\\n\\nstretch of road, and if Tom was going to win the impromptu\\n\\ncontest it seemed high time he began.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Can you catch him?\" asked Ned anxiously.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Watch,\" was his chum\\'s reply. \"I haven\\'t used my high speed\\n\\ngear yet. I\\'m afraid the fuses won\\'t stand it, but here goes for\\n\\na try, anyhow.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe threw over a switch, changed a lever and then, having pushed\\n\\ninto place the last gear, he grasped the steering wheel more\\n\\nfirmly.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was need of it, for, in an instant, the electric\\n\\nrunabout, with the motors fairly roaring, swept up the road,\\n\\nafter the gasolene car that was almost hidden from sight in a\\n\\ncloud of dust. Faster and faster went Tom\\'s car. The young\\n\\ninventor was listening with critical ear to the song of the\\n\\nmachinery. He wanted to learn if it was running sweet and true,\\n\\nfor that is how a careful mechanic tests his apparatus. Foot by\\n\\nfoot the distance between the two cars lessened. Now the electric\\n\\nwas lapping the rear wheels of the gasolene machine, but the\\n\\ndriver did not know it. His whole attention was on the road ahead\\n\\nof him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Half a mile more!\" cried Ned, naming the distance which yet\\n\\nremained of the straight stretch. \"Can you do it, Tom?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHis chum nodded. He shoved the controller handle over to the\\n\\nlast notch, and then waited an anxious second. Would the fuse\\n\\ncarry the extra load? It seemed so, for there was a slight\\n\\nincrease of power.\\n\\n\\n\\nAn instant later Tom gave a sudden twist to the steering wheel.\\n\\nIt was well that he did, for he was passing the gasolene car\\n\\ndangerously close. Then he was ahead of it, and in a second he\\n\\nwas three lengths in advance.\\n\\n\\n\\nDesperately the man opened his muffler, and sought to gain by\\n\\nthis advantage, but though his car gave off explosions like a\\n\\nbattery of guns in action, he could not gain on Tom. The electric\\n\\nshot around a curve in the road, winner of the impromptu race by\\n\\nan eighth of a mile.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" asked Tom of his chum, as he slowed down, for the road\\n\\nnow was not so good, \"did I do it?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You certainly did. Whew! But we did scoot along?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Eighty miles an hour there one spell,\" went on the young\\n\\ninventor, glancing at a gauge. \"But I\\'ve got to do better than\\n\\nthat to win the big race.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV              ANDY FOGER\\'S BLACK EYE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAround the bend came the six-cylinder touring car. The driver,\\n\\nwith a surprised look on his face, was slacking up. He ran his\\n\\nmachine up alongside of Tom\\'s.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Say,\" he asked, in dazed tones, \"did you take a short cut, or\\n\\nanything like that to get ahead of me?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No,\" answered the youth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And you didn\\'t jump me in the air?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No,\" was Tom\\'s answer, smilingly given.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, all I\\'ve got to say is that you\\'ve got a wonderful car\\n\\nthere, Mr.--er--er--\"  He paused suggestively.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Swift is my name,\" our hero answered. \"Thomas Swift, of\\n\\nShopton.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ah, I\\'ve heard of you. My name is Layton --Paul Layton. I\\'m\\n\\nfrom Netherton. Let\\'s see, you built an airship, didn\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I helped,\" Tom admitted modestly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, you beat me fair and square, and if I do say it myself\\n\\nI\\'ve got a fairly speedy car. Took two firsts at the Indianapolis\\n\\nmeet last month. But you certainly scooted ahead of me. Where did\\n\\nyou buy that electric, if I may ask?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I made it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I might have known,\" admitted the man. \"But are you going to\\n\\nput them on the market? If you are I\\'d like to get one. I want\\n\\nthe fastest car going, and you seem to have it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I hadn\\'t thought of manufacturing them for sale,\" said the\\n\\nyoung inventor. \"If I do, I\\'ll let you know.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I wish you would. My! I had no idea you could beat me, but you\\n\\ndid--fair and square.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was some more talk, and then Mr. Layton started on, after\\n\\nexacting from Tom a further promise to let him know if any\\n\\nelectrics were to be made for sale.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You certainly have a wonderful car,\" complimented Ned, as he\\n\\nand his chum took a short cut to Shopton.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m not quite satisfied with it,\" declared Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why not?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ve set a hundred miles an hour as my limit. I didn\\'t\\n\\nmake but eighty to-day. I\\'ve got to have more speed if I go up\\n\\nagainst the crowd that will race for the touring club\\'s prize.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Can you make a hundred miles?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I think so. I\\'ve got to change my gears, though, and use\\n\\nheavier fuses. I was afraid every second that one of the fuses\\n\\nwould melt, and leave me stranded. But they stood pretty well. Of\\n\\ncourse, when the car, geared as it is now, has been run a little\\n\\nlonger it will go faster, but it won\\'t come up to a hundred miles\\n\\nan hour. That\\'s what I want, and that\\'s what I\\'m going to get,\"\\n\\nand the lad looked very determined.\\n\\n\\n\\nNed was taken to the bank, and, as Tom turned his machine\\n\\naround, to go home, he saw, standing on the steps of the new\\n\\nbank, which was almost across the street from the old one, Andy\\n\\nFoger, and the bully\\'s father. The red-haired lad laughed at\\n\\nTom\\'s rough looking car, and said something to his parent, but\\n\\nMr. Foger did not notice Tom. Not that this caused our hero any\\n\\nuneasiness, however.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut, as he swung away from the bank, he saw, coming up the\\n\\nstreet a figure that instantly attracted his attention. It was\\n\\nthat of Mr. Berg, and Tom at once recalled the night he had\\n\\npursued the submarine agent, and torn loose his watch charm. Mr.\\n\\nBerg was evidently going to enter the new bank, for, at the sight\\n\\nof the former agent, Mr. Foger descended the steps, and went to\\n\\nmeet him.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom, however, had decided upon a plan of action. He steered his\\n\\nmachine in toward the curb, ran up the steel wind-shield, and\\n\\ncalled:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Mr. Berg!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Eh? What\\'s that?\" asked the agent, in some surprise. Then, as\\n\\nhe caught sight of Tom, and recognized him, he added: \"I\\'m very\\n\\nbusy now, my young friend. You\\'ll have to excuse me.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I won\\'t detain you a moment,\" went on Tom, casually. \"I have\\n\\nsomething of yours that I wish to return to you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Something of mine?\" Mr. Berg was evidently puzzled. He\\n\\napproached the electric car, in spite of the fact that Mr. Foger\\n\\nwas calling him. \"Something of mine? What is it?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"This!\" exclaimed Tom suddenly, extending the compass watch\\n\\ncharm, which he always carried with him of late.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That! Where did you get that. I lost it--\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Berg paused in some confusion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I grabbed it off your watch chain the night you were hiding in\\n\\nour shrubbery, and tripped me into the brook,\" answered the lad,\\n\\nlooking the man squarely in the eye.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hiding? Tripped you? Grabbed that off my chain--\" stammered\\n\\nMr. Berg. He had taken the charm up in his fingers, but now he\\n\\nquickly dropped it back into Tom\\'s hand. \"I guess you\\'re\\n\\nmistaken,\" he added quickly. \"That\\'s not mine. I never had one--\\n\\nI--er--that\\'s not mine--at least--Oh, you\\'ll have to excuse me,\\n\\nyoung man, I\\'m in a hurry, and I have an important engagement!\"\\n\\nand with that Mr. Berg wheeled off, and joined Mr. Foger, who\\n\\nstood on the sidewalk, waiting for him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I thought sure it was yours,\" said Tom, easily. \"Perhaps Mr.\\n\\nFoger will keep it in one of the safety-deposit boxes of his\\n\\nbank, until the owner claims it,\" and he looked at the banker.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\" asked Andy\\'s father.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"This watch charm which I grabbed off Mr. Berg\\'s chain the\\n\\nnight he was sneaking around our house, and crossed the electric\\n\\nwires,\" went on the lad.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Don\\'t listen to him. He doesn\\'t know what he is saying!\"\\n\\nexclaimed the former submarine boat agent. \"It\\'s not my charm.\\n\\nHe\\'s crazy!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, am I?\" thought Tom, with a grim look on his face. \"Well,\\n\\nwe\\'ll see about that, Mr. Berg,\" and, putting the charm back in\\n\\nhis pocket, Tom swung his machine toward home, while the agent\\n\\nand the banker entered the new institution.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So they\\'re getting chummy,\" mused Tom. \"Andy and Berg were\\n\\nfriends when Andy shut me up in the submarine tank, and now Berg\\n\\ncomes here to do business, and Foger and his associates are\\n\\ntrying to put the old bank out of business. I wonder if there\\'s\\n\\nany connection there? I must keep my eyes open. Berg is an\\n\\nunscrupulous man, and so is Andy\\'s father, to say nothing of the\\n\\nred-haired bully himself. He had nerve to deny that was his\\n\\ncharm. Well, maybe I\\'ll catch him some day.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom spent a busy week making new adjustments to his electric\\n\\ncar, changing the gear and providing for heavier fuses. He was\\n\\nplanning for another trip on the road, as the time for the great\\n\\nrace was drawing near, and he wanted the mechanism to be in\\n\\nperfect shape.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne evening, as he was preparing for a short night trip to\\n\\nMansburg, where he had promised to call for Miss Nestor, Tom left\\n\\nhis machine standing in the road in front of the house, while he\\n\\nwent back to get a robe, as it threatened to be chilly.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he came back to enter the car, he saw some one standing near\\n\\nit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Is that you, Ned?\" he called. \"Come, take a spin.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHardly had he spoken than there sounded from the machine a\\n\\nwhirr that told of the current being turned on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Don\\'t do that!\" cried Tom, knowing at once that it could not\\n\\nbe Ned, who never meddled with the machinery.\\n\\n\\n\\nA blinding flash and a loud report followed, and Tom saw some\\n\\none leap from his car, and try to run away. But the figure\\n\\nstumbled, and, a moment later the young inventor was upon him,\\n\\ngrappling with him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Here! Let me go!\" cried a voice, and Tom uttered an\\n\\nexclamation of surprise.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Andy Foger!\" he cried. \"I\\'ve caught you! You tried to damage\\n\\nmy car!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, and I\\'m hurt, too!\" whined Andy. \"My father will sue you\\n\\nfor damages if I die.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No danger of that; you\\'re too mean,\" murmured Tom, as he\\n\\nmaintained a tight grip on the bully.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You let me go!\" demanded Andy, squirming to get away.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Wait until I see what damage you\\'ve done,\\'~ retorted the young\\n\\ninventor. \"The worst, though, would be the blowing out of a fuse,\\n\\nfor I had the gear disconnected. You wait a minute now. Maybe\\n\\nit\\'s you who\\'ll have to pay damages.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You let me go!\" fairly screamed Andy, and he aimed a blow at\\n\\nTom. It caught our hero on the chest and Tom\\'s fighting blood was\\n\\nup in an instant. He drew back his left hand, and delivered a\\n\\nblow that landed fairly on Andy\\'s right eye. The bully staggered\\n\\nand went down in the dust.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There!\" cried Tom, righteously angry. \"That will teach you not\\n\\nto try to damage my car, and then hit me into the bargain! Now\\n\\nclear out, before I give you some more!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWhining and blubbering Andy arose to his feet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You just wait. I\\'ll get square with you for this,\" he\\n\\nthreatened.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You can accept part of that as pay for what you did in the tar\\n\\nand feathering game,\" added Tom. Then, as Andy moved in front of\\n\\none of the electric side lamps on the car, Tom uttered a whistle\\n\\nof surprise. For both of Andy\\'s eyes were bruised and swollen,\\n\\nthough Tom had only hit him once.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Look at me!\" cried the bully, more squint-eyed than ever.\\n\\n\"Look at me! You hit me in one eye, and that explosion hit me in\\n\\nthe other! My father will sue you for this.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he hurried off down the road Tom understood. Andy coming\\n\\nalong, had seen Tom\\'s car standing there, and, thinking to do\\n\\nsome mischief, had climbed in, and turned on the power. Perhaps\\n\\nhe hoped it would run into the roadside ditch and be smashed. But\\n\\nas the gear was out, turning on the electric current had a\\n\\ndifferent effect. As the bully pulled the handle over too\\n\\nquickly, throwing almost the entire force of the battery into the\\n\\nwires at once, the load was too heavy for them. A safety fuse\\n\\nblew out, causing the flare and the explosion, and a piece of the\\n\\nsoft lead-like metal had hit the red-haired lad in the eye. Tom\\'s\\n\\nfist had completed the work on the other optic, and for several\\n\\ndays thereafter Andy Foger remained in seclusion. When he did go\\n\\nout there were many embarrassing questions put to him, as to when\\n\\nhe had had the fight. Andy didn\\'t care to answer. As for Tom, it\\n\\ndid not take long to put a new fuse in his car, and he greatly\\n\\nenjoyed his ride with Miss Nestor that night.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI             TROUBLE AT THE BANK\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nComing in rather late from his trip to Mansburg, and thinking\\n\\nof some things he and Miss Nestor had talked about, Tom was\\n\\nrather surprised, on reaching the house, to see a light in his\\n\\nfather\\'s particular room, where the aged inventor did his reading\\n\\nand his planning of new devices.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Dad\\'s up rather late,\" said Tom to himself. \"I wonder if he\\'s\\n\\nstudying over some new machine.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe lad ran his auto into the temporary garage he had built for\\n\\nit, and connected the wires of a burglar alarm he had arranged,\\n\\nto give warning in case any of his enemies should seek to damage\\n\\nthe car.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom encountered Garret Jackson, the aged inventor who was going\\n\\nhis rounds, seeing that everything was all right about the\\n\\nvarious shops.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Anybody with my father, Garret?\" asked the lad. \"I see he\\'s\\n\\nstill up.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes,\" was the rather unexpected reply. \"Mr. Damon is with him.\\n\\nThey\\'ve been in your father\\'s room all the evening--ever since\\n\\nyou went away in the car.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Anything the matter?\" inquired the young inventor, a bit\\n\\nanxious, as he thought of the Happy Harry gang.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know,\" and the engineer seemed puzzled. \"They\\n\\ncalled me in once to know if everything was all right outside,\\n\\nand to inquire if you were back. I saw, then, that they were busy\\n\\nfiguring over something, but I didn\\'t take much notice. Only I\\n\\nheard Mr. Damon say: \\'There\\'s going to be trouble if we can\\'t\\n\\nrealize on those bonds,\\' and then I came away.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Is that all he said?\" asked Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, he said \\'Bless my buttons,\\' or something like that; but he\\n\\nblesses so many things I didn\\'t pay much attention.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s right,\" agreed the lad. \"But I wonder what the trouble\\n\\nis about? I must go see.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he passed along the hall, out of which his father\\'s combined\\n\\nstudy and library opened, the aged inventor came to the door.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Is that you, Tom?\" he asked.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, Dad.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Come in here, if you haven\\'t anything else to do. Mr. Damon is\\n\\nhere.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom needed but a single glance at the faces of his father and\\n\\nMr. Damon to see that something was troubling the two. The table\\n\\nin front of them was littered with papers covered with rows of\\n\\nfigures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" asked Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I suppose I ought not to let it bother me, but it does,\"\\n\\nreplied his father.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Something wrong with your patents, Dad? Has the crowd of bad\\n\\nmen been bothering you again?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, it isn\\'t that. It\\'s trouble at the bank, Tom.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Has it been robbed again?\" asked the lad quickly. \"If it has I\\n\\ncan prove an alibi,\" and he smiled at the recollection of the\\n\\ntime he and Mr. Damon had been accused of looting the vault, as\\n\\ntold in \"Tom Swift and His Airship.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, it hasn\\'t been robbed in just that way,\" put in Mr. Damon.\\n\\n\"But, bless my shoe laces, it\\'s almost as bad! You see, Tom,\\n\\nsince Mr. Foger started the new bank he\\'s done his best to\\n\\ncripple the one in which your father and I are interested. I may\\n\\nsay we are very vitally interested in it, for, since the\\n\\nwithdrawal of Foger and his associates, your father and I have\\n\\nbeen elected directors.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t know that,\" remarked the lad.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, I didn\\'t tell you, because you were so busy on your\\n\\nelectric car,\" rejoined Mr. Swift. \"But Mr. Damon and I, being\\n\\nboth large depositors, were asked to assume office, and, as I was\\n\\nnot very busy on patent affairs, I consented.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But what is the trouble?\" inquired Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m coming to it,\" resumed Mr. Damon. \"Bless my check book,\\n\\nI\\'m coming to it! You see we have lost several good customers, by\\n\\nreason of Foger opening the new bank. That wouldn\\'t have mattered\\n\\nso much, as between your father and myself, and one or two\\n\\nothers, we have enough capital to carry on the business of the\\n\\nbank. But there is a more serious matter. We hold a number of\\n\\nvery good securities, but they are of a class hard to realize\\n\\ncash for, on short notice. In other words they are not active\\n\\nbonds, though they are issued by reliable concerns. Then, too,\\n\\nthe bank has lost considerable money by not doing as much\\n\\nbusiness as it formerly did. In short we don\\'t know just what to\\n\\ndo, Tom, and your father and I were discussing it, when you came\\n\\nin.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Do you need more money?\" asked Tom. \"I have some, that is my\\n\\nshare from the submarine treasure, and some I have allowed to\\n\\naccumulate as royalties from my patents. It\\'s about ten thousand\\n\\ndollars, and you\\'re welcome to it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Thank you, Tom,\" spoke his father. \"We may use your cash, but\\n\\nwe\\'ll need a great deal more than that.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But why?\" asked the lad. \"I don\\'t understand. If you have good\\n\\nbonds, can\\'t you dispose of them, and get the money?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We could, Tom, yes, if we had time,\" replied Mr. Damon. \"But\\n\\nto throw the bonds on the market at short notice would mean that\\n\\nwe would not get a good price for them. We would lose\\n\\nconsiderable.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But why do it in a hurry?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Because there is need of hurry,\" responded Mr. Swift.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s it,\" joined in Mr. Damon. \"We have to have cash in a\\n\\nhurry, Tom, to meet pressing demands, and we don\\'t just see our\\n\\nway clear to get it. I am trying to raise it on some private\\n\\nsecurities I own, but I can\\'t get an answer within several days.\\n\\nMeanwhile the bank may fail, because of lack of funds. Of course\\n\\nno one would lose anything, ultimately, as we could go into the\\n\\nhands of a receiver, and, eventually pay dollar for dollar. Your\\n\\nfather and I, and some of the other directors, might lose a\\n\\nlittle, but the depositors would not. But your father and I don\\'t\\n\\nlike the idea of failing. It\\'s something I\\'ve never done, and I\\'m\\n\\ntoo old to start in now, bless my cash ledger if I\\'m not!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And for the sake of my reputation in this community I don\\'t\\n\\nwant to see the bank close its doors,\" added Mr. Swift. \"It would\\n\\ngive Foger too good a chance to crow over us.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And you need cash in a hurry,\" went on Tom. \"How much?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Fifty thousand dollars at least,\" replied Mr. Damon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And if you don\\'t get it?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe eccentric man shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" remarked Mr. Swift musingly, \"I don\\'t see that we need\\n\\nworry you about it, Tom. Perhaps--\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Swift was interrupted by a ring at the front door. The\\n\\nthree looked at each other. It was late for a caller, and Mrs.\\n\\nBaggert had gone to bed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll answer it,\" volunteered Tom. He switched on the electric\\n\\nlight in the hall, and opened the door. He was confronted by Mr.\\n\\nPendergast, the president of the bank.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Is your father in?\" asked Mr. Pendergast, and he seemed to be\\n\\nmuch agitated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, he is,\" replied the lad. \"Come this way, please.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I want to see him on important business,\" went on the\\n\\npresident, as he followed the young inventor. \"I\\'m afraid I have\\n\\nbad news for him and Mr. Damon. Bad news, Tom, bad news,\" and the\\n\\naged banker\\'s voice trembled. Tom, with a chill of apprehension\\n\\nseeming to clutch his heart, threw open the library door.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII            A RUN ON THE BANK\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why, Mr. Pendergast!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon, rising quickly as\\n\\nTom ushered in the aged president. \"Whatever is the matter? You\\n\\nhere at this hour? Bless my trial balance! Is anything wrong?\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid there is,\" answered the bank head. \"I have just\\n\\nreceived word which made it necessary for me to see you both at\\n\\nonce. I\\'m glad you\\'re here, Mr. Damon.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe sank wearily into a chair which Tom placed for him, and Mr.\\n\\nSwift asked:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Have you been able to raise any cash, Mr. Pendergast?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, I am sorry to say I have not, but I did not come here to\\n\\ntell you that. I have bad news for you. As soon as we open our\\n\\ndoors in the morning, there will be a run on the bank.\" \"A run on\\n\\nthe bank?\" repeated Mr. Swift.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The moment we begin business in the morning,\" went on Mr.\\n\\nPendergast.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my soul, then don\\'t begin business!\" cried Mr. Damon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We must,\" insisted Mr. Pendergast. \"To keep the doors closed\\n\\nwould be a confession at once that we have failed. No, it is\\n\\nbetter to open them, and stand the run as long as we can. When we\\n\\nhave exhausted our cash--\" he paused.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well?\" asked Mr. Damon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then we\\'ll fail--that\\'s all.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But we mustn\\'t let the bank fail!\" cried Mr. Swift. \"I am\\n\\nwilling to put some of my personal fortune into the bank capital\\n\\nin order to save it. So is my son here.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s right,\" chimed in Tom heartily. \"All I\\'ve got. I\\'m not\\n\\ngoing to let Andy Foger get ahead of us; nor his father either.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll help to the limit of my ability,\" added Mr. Damon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I appreciate all that,\" continued the president. \"But the\\n\\nunfortunate part of it is that we need cash. You gentlemen, like\\n\\nmyself, probably, have your money tied up in stocks and bonds. It\\n\\nis hard to get cash quickly, and we must have cash as soon as we\\n\\nopen in the morning, to pay the depositors who will come flocking\\n\\nto the doors. We must prepare for a run on the bank.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"How do you know there will be a run?\" asked the young\\n\\ninventor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I received word this evening, just before I came here,\"\\n\\nreplied Mr. Pendergast. \"A poor widow, who has a small amount in\\n\\nthe bank, called on me and said she had been advised to withdraw\\n\\nall her cash. She said she preferred to see me about it first, as\\n\\nshe did not like to lose her interest. She said a number of her\\n\\nacquaintances, some of whom are quite heavy depositors, had also\\n\\nbeen warned that the bank was unsound, and that they ought to\\n\\ntake out their savings and deposits at once.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Did she say who had thus warned her?\" inquired Mr. Swift.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"She did,\" was the reply, \"and that shows me that there is a\\n\\nconspiracy on foot to ruin our bank. She stated that Mr. Foger\\n\\nhad told her our institution was unsound.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Mr. Foger!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"So this is one of his tricks to\\n\\nbolster up his new bank! He hopes the people who withdraw their\\n\\nmoney from our bank will deposit with him. I see his game. He\\'s a\\n\\nscoundrel, and if it\\'s possible I\\'m going to sue him for damages\\n\\nafter this thing is over.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Did he warn the others?\" inquired the aged inventor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not all of them,\" answered the president. \"Some received\\n\\nletters from a man signing himself Addison Berg, warning them\\n\\nthat our bank, was likely to fail any day.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Addison Berg!\" exclaimed Tom. \"That must have been the\\n\\nimportant business he had with Mr. Foger, the day I showed him\\n\\nthe watch charm! They were plotting the ruin of our bank then,\"\\n\\nand he told his father about his disastrous pursuit of the\\n\\nsubmarine agent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Very likely Foger is working with Berg,\" admitted Mr. Damon.\\n\\n\"We will attend to them later. The question is, what can we do to\\n\\nsave the bank?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Get cash, and plenty of it,\" advised Mr. Pendergast. \"Suppose\\n\\nwe go over the whole situation again?\" and they fell to talking\\n\\nstocks: bonds, securities, mortgages and interest, until the\\n\\nyouth, interested as he was in the situation, could follow it no\\n\\nlonger.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Better go to bed, Tom,\" advised his father. \"You can\\'t help us\\n\\nany, and we have many details to go over.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe lad reluctantly consented, and he was soon dreaming that he\\n\\nwas in his electric auto, trying to pull up a thousand pound lump\\n\\nof gold from the bottom of the sea. He awoke to find the\\n\\nbedclothes in a lump on his chest, and, removing them, fell into\\n\\na deep slumber.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the young inventor awoke the next morning, Mrs. Baggert\\n\\ntold him that his father and Mr. Damon had risen nearly an hour\\n\\nbefore, had partaken of a hearty breakfast, and departed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They told me to tell you they were at the bank,\" said the\\n\\nhousekeeper.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Did Mr. Pendergast stay all night?\" inquired Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I heard some one go away about two o\\'clock this morning,\"\\n\\nreplied the housekeeper. \"I don\\'t know who it was.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They must have had a long session,\" thought Tom, as he began\\n\\non his bacon, eggs and coffee. \"I\\'ll take a run down to the bank\\n\\nin my electric in a little while.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe car was still in rather crude shape, outwardly, but the\\n\\nmechanism was now almost perfect. Tom charged the batteries well\\n\\nbefore starting put.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe youth had no sooner come in sight of the old Shopton bank,\\n\\nto distinguish it from the Second National, which Mr. Foger had\\n\\nstarted, than he was aware that something unusual had occurred.\\n\\nThere was quite a crowd about it, and more persons were\\n\\nconstantly arriving to swell the throng.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" asked Tom, of one of the few police\\n\\nofficers of which Shopton boasted, though the lad did not need to\\n\\nbe told.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Run on the bank,\" was the brief answer. \"It\\'s failed.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom felt a pang of disappointment. Somehow, he had hoped that\\n\\nhis father and his friends might have been able to stave off\\n\\nruin. As he approached nearer Tom was made aware that the crowd\\n\\nwas in an ugly mood.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t they open the doors and give us our money?\" cried\\n\\none excited woman. \"It\\'s ours! I worked hard for mine, an\\' now\\n\\nthey want to keep it from us. I wish I\\'d put it in the new bank.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, that\\'s the best place,\" added another. \"That Mr. Foger\\n\\nhas lots of money.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I can see the hand of Andy\\'s father, and that of Mr. Berg, at\\n\\nwork here,\" thought Tom, \"They have spread rumors of the bank\\'s\\n\\ntrouble, and hope to profit by it. I wish I could find a way to\\n\\nbeat them at their own game.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the minutes passed, and the bank was not opened, the ugly\\n\\ntemper of the crowd increased. The few police could do nothing\\n\\nwith the mob, and several, bolder than the rest, advocated\\n\\nbattering down the doors. Some went up the steps and began to\\n\\npound on the portals. Tom looked for a sight of his father or Mr.\\n\\nDamon, but could not see either.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was not the regular hour for opening the bank, but when the\\n\\npolice reminded the people of this they only laughed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I guess they ain\\'t going to open anyhow!\" shouted a man.\\n\\n\"They\\'ve got our money, and they\\'re going to keep it. What\\n\\ndifference is an hour, anyway?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, if they have the money, why don\\'t they open, and not wait\\n\\nuntil ten o\\'clock?\" cried another. \"I\\'ve got a hundred and five\\n\\ndollars in there, and I want it!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMore excited persons were arriving every minute. The crowd\\n\\nsurged this way, and that. Many looked anxiously at the clock in\\n\\nthe tower of the town hall. The gilded hands pointed to a few\\n\\nminutes of ten. Would the bank open its doors when the hour\\n\\nboomed out? Many were anxiously asking this question.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom sat in his electric car, near the front of the bank. The\\n\\ninterest of the crowd, which under ordinary circumstances would\\n\\nhave been centered in the queer vehicle, was not drawn toward it.\\n\\nThe people were all thinking of their money.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly one of the two doors of the bank slowly opened. There\\n\\nwas a yell from the crowd, and a rush to get in. But the police\\n\\nmanaged to hold the leaders back, and then Tom saw that it was\\n\\nNed Newton, who stood in the partly-opened portal. He held up his\\n\\nhand to indicate silence, and a hush fell over the mob.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The bank is open for business,\" Ned announced, \"but there must\\n\\nbe no rush. The building is not large enough to accommodate you\\n\\nall. If you form a line, you will be admitted in turn. The bank\\n\\nhopes to pay you all.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hopes!\" cried a woman scornfully. \"We can\\'t eat hopes, young\\n\\nman, nor yet pay the rent with it. Hopes indeed!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Ned had said all he cared to, and, with rather a white\\n\\nface, he went back inside. The one door remained open and, with a\\n\\npoliceman on either side, a line of anxious depositors was slowly\\n\\nformed. Tom watched them crowding and surging forward, all eager\\n\\nto be first to get their cash out, lest there be not enough for\\n\\nall. As he watched, the young inventor was aware that some was\\n\\nsignaling to him from the big window of the bank. He looked more\\n\\nclosely and saw Ned Newton beckoning to him, and the young\\n\\ncashier was motioning Tom to go around to the rear, where a door\\n\\nof the bank opened on a small alley. Wondering what was wanted,\\n\\nTom slowly ran his machine down the side street, and up the\\n\\nalley. No one paid any attention to him.\\n\\n\\n\\nA porter admitted the lad, and he made his way to the private\\n\\noffices, where he knew his father and Mr. Damon would be. In the\\n\\ncorridors he could hear the murmur of the throng and the chink of\\n\\nmoney, as the tellers paid it out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, Tom, this is bad business,\" remarked Mr. Swift, as he\\n\\nsaw his son. The lad noticed that Mr. Damon was in the telephone\\n\\nbooth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, Dad,\" admitted Tom. \"It\\'s a run, all right. What are you\\n\\ngoing to do?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The best we can. Pay out all the cash we have, and hope that\\n\\nbefore that time, the people will come to their senses. The bank\\n\\nis all right if they would only wait. But I\\'m afraid they won\\'t\\n\\nand, after we pay out all the cash we have, we\\'ll have to close\\n\\nthe doors. Then there\\'s sure to be an unpleasant scene, and maybe\\n\\nsome of the more hot-headed ones will advocate violence. We have\\n\\ngiven orders to the tellers to pay out as slowly as possible, so\\n\\nas to enable us to gain some time.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And all you need is money; is that it, Dad?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s it, Tom, but we have exhausted every possibility. Mr.\\n\\nDamon is trying a forlorn hope now, but, even if he is\\n\\nsuccessful--\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore Mr. Swift had ceased speaking, Mr. Damon fairly burst\\n\\nfrom the telephone booth. He was much excited.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got it! I\\'ve got it!\" he cried.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What?\" asked Mr. Swift and Tom in the same breath.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The cash, or, what\\'s just as good, the promise of it. I called\\n\\nup Mr. Chase, of the Clayton National Bank, and he has agreed to\\n\\ntake the railroad securities I offered him as collateral, and let\\n\\nme have sixty thousand dollars on them! That will give us cash\\n\\nenough to weather the storm. Hurrah! We\\'re all right now. Bless\\n\\nmy check book!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The Clayton National Bank,\" remarked Mr. Swift, and his voice\\n\\nwas hopeless. \"It\\'s forty miles away, Mr. Damon, and no railroad\\n\\naround here runs anywhere near it. No one could get there and\\n\\nback with the cash to-day, in time to save us from ruin. It\\'s\\n\\nimpossible! Our last chance is gone.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"How far did you say it was, Dad?\" asked Tom quickly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Forty miles there, over forty, I guess, and not very good\\n\\nroads. We would need to have the cash here before three o\\'clock\\n\\nto be of any service to us. No, it\\'s out of the question. The\\n\\nbank will have to fail!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No!\" cried the young inventor, and his voice rang out through\\n\\nthe room. \"I\\'ll get the cash for you!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"How?\" gasped Mr. Damon. \"You can\\'t get there and back in\\n\\ntime?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, I can!\" cried Tom. \"In my electric runabout! I can make\\n\\nit go a hundred miles an hour, if necessary! Probably I\\'ll have\\n\\nto run slow over the bad roads; but I can do it! I know I can.\\n\\nI\\'ll get the sixty thousand dollars for you!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a moment there was silence. Then Mr. Damon cried:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Good! And I\\'ll go with you and deliver the securities to Mr.\\n\\nChase. Come on, Tom Swift! Bless my collar button, but maybe we\\n\\ncan yet save the old bank after all!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII                   AFTER THE CASH\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTom\\'s proposal as a way out of the difficulty, and the prompt\\n\\nseconding of it by Mr. Damon, seemed to deprive the other bank\\n\\nofficials, Mr. Swift included, of the power of speech for a few\\n\\nmoments. Then, as there came to the room where the scene had\\n\\ntaken place, the sound of the mob outside, clamoring for cash,\\n\\nMr. Pendergast, the president, remarked in a low voice:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It seems to be the only way. Do you think you can do it, Tom\\n\\nSwift?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure of it, as far as my electric car is concerned,\"\\n\\nreplied the young inventor. \"If we get the cash I\\'ll have it back\\n\\nhere on time. The runabout is all ready for a fast trip.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then don\\'t lose any time, Tom,\" advised his father. \"Every\\n\\nminute counts.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes,\" added Mr. Damon. \"Come on. I\\'ve got the securities in my\\n\\nvalise, and we can bring the cash back in the same satchel. Come\\n\\non, Tom.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe eccentric character caught up his valise, and started from\\n\\nthe room. Tom followed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Now, my son, be careful,\" advised his father. \"You know the\\n\\nneed of haste, but don\\'t take unnecessary risks. You\\'d better go\\n\\nout the back way, as the crowd is easily excited.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nLittle more was said. Mr. Swift clasped his son\\'s hand in a\\n\\nfirm pressure, and the bank president nervously bade the lad\\n\\ngood-by. Then, slipping out of the bank, by the rear entrance,\\n\\nthe porter closing the door after them, Tom and Mr. Damon took\\n\\ntheir places in the electric machine.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Just imagine you\\'re racing for that three-thousand-dollar\\n\\nprize, offered by the Touring Club of America, Tom,\" observed Mr.\\n\\nDamon, as he deposited the valise at his feet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t have to do that,\" replied the youth. \"I\\'m trying for a\\n\\nbigger prize than that. I want to save the bank, and defeat the\\n\\nschemes of the Fogers--father and son.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom turned on the power, and the machine rolled out on the main\\n\\nstreet. As it turned the corner, leaving the impatient crowd of\\n\\ndepositors, now larger than ever, behind, Mr. Damon glanced over\\n\\nat the new bank, and, as he did so, he called to Tom:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There are the Fogers now.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe young inventor looked, and saw Andy and his father on the\\n\\nsteps of the new institution.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the sight of the electric car, speeding along, Andy turned\\n\\nand spoke to his parent. What he said seemed to impress Mr.\\n\\nFoger, for he started, and looked more intently at Tom and Mr.\\n\\nDamon. Then, as Tom watched, he saw the two excitedly conversing,\\n\\nand a moment later Andy ran off in the direction in which Sam\\n\\nSnedecker and Pete Bailey lived.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I wonder if he\\'s up to any tricks?\" thought Tom, as he turned\\n\\non more power. \"Well, if he is, I\\'ll soon be where he can\\'t reach\\n\\nme.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe young inventor did not dare send his car at full speed\\n\\nthrough the streets of the town, and it was not until several\\n\\nminutes had passed that they could go at more than the ordinary\\n\\nrate. But once the open country was reached Tom \"opened her up\\n\\nfull,\" and the song the motor sung was one of power. The vehicle\\n\\nquickly gathered headway and was soon fairly whizzing along.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If we keep this up we\\'ll be there and back in good time,\"\\n\\nremarked Mr. Damon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, but we can\\'t do it,\" replied his companion. \"The road to\\n\\nClayton is a poor one, and we\\'ll soon be on it. Then we\\'ll have\\n\\nto go slow. But I\\'ll make all the time I can until then.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, for several miles more they crept along, at times having to\\n\\nreduce to almost a walking pace, because of bad roads. Mr. Damon\\n\\nlooked at his watch almost every other minute.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Eleven o\\'clock,\" he remarked, as they passed a milestone, \"and\\n\\nwe\\'re not half way there. Bless my gizzard, but I\\'m afraid we\\n\\nwon\\'t make it, Tom. We left about ten, and we ought to be back by\\n\\ntwo o\\'clock to do any good. That\\'s four hours, and it will take\\n\\nsome time to transfer the securities, and get the cash. Every\\n\\nminute counts.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I know it,\" answered Tom, \"and I\\'m going to count every\\n\\nminute.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWith eager eyes he watched every inch of the road, to steer to\\n\\nthe best advantage. His hands gripped the wheel until his\\n\\nknuckles showed white with the strain, and, every now and then\\n\\nhis right hand adjusted the speed lever or the controller handle,\\n\\nwhile his foot was on the emergency brake, ready to stop the car\\n\\nat the first sign of danger.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd there was danger, not infrequently, for the road was up and\\n\\ndown hill, over frail bridges, and along steep cliffs. It was no\\n\\npleasure tour they were on.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen a little over half the distance had been made they came to\\n\\na better road, and Tom was able to use full speed ahead. Then the\\n\\nelectric went so fast that, had it not been for the steel wind-\\n\\nshield in front, Mr. Damon, at any rate, would have been short of\\n\\nbreath.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"This is going some!\" he cried to Tom. The lad nodded grimly,\\n\\nand shoved the controller handle over to the last notch. Then\\n\\ncame a bad stretch and they had to slow down again. As they were\\n\\nabout out of it there came a little flash of fire and the motor\\n\\nstopped.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my overshoes!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"What\\'s that; a fuse\\n\\nblown out?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No,\" replied Tom, with a puzzled air. \"But something has gone\\n\\nwrong.\"  Hastily he got out, and made an examination. He found it\\n\\nwas only one of the unimportant wires which had short-circuited,\\n\\nand it was soon adjusted. But they had lost five precious\\n\\nminutes. Tom tried to make up for lost time, but came to a hill a\\n\\nlittle later, and this reduced their speed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Do you think we can make it before twelve?\" asked Mr. Damon\\n\\nanxiously. \"We\\'ve got to, if we\\'re to get back before three,\\n\\nTom.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll try,\" was the calm answer, and Tom\\'s jaw was shut still\\n\\nmore tightly. Once again came more favorable roads and pushing\\n\\nthe car to the limit the occupants were rejoiced, a little later,\\n\\nas they topped a hill, to come in sight of a fairly large city.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There\\'s Clayton!\" cried Mr. Damon.\\n\\n\\n\\nTen minutes later they were rolling through the main street,\\n\\nand as they stopped in front of the bank, the noon whistles blew\\n\\nshrill and noisily.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You did it, Tom!\" cried Mr. Damon, springing out with the\\n\\nvalise of securities. \"Now be ready for the return trip. I\\'ll be\\n\\nwith you as soon as possible.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe went up the bank steps three at a time, like some boy\\n\\ninstead of an elderly man. Tom looked after him for a second and\\n\\nthen got down to oil up his car, and make some adjustments that\\n\\nhad rattled loose from the rough road. Unmindful of the curious\\n\\nthrong that gathered he crawled under the machine with his oil-\\n\\ncan.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe had finished his work, and was back in his seat, ready to\\n\\nstart, but Mr. Damon had not reappeared.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s taking him a good while to get that cash,\" thought Tom.\\n\\n\"Maybe the securities were no good.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut, a few minutes later, Mr. Damon came hurrying from the\\n\\nbank. The valise he carried seemed much heavier than when he went\\n\\nin.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s all right, Tom,\" he said. \"I\\'ve got it. Now for the trip\\n\\nhome, and I hope we don\\'t have any accidents. It took longer than\\n\\nI thought to check over the bonds and receipt for them. But I\\'ve\\n\\ngot the cash. Now to save the bank!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe took his place beside the young inventor, holding the valise\\n\\nbetween his knees, while Tom turned on the power and sent his car\\n\\ndashing down the street, and toward the road that led to Shopton.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX             STOPPED ON THE ROAD\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Did Mr. Chase make any objection to giving you the cash?\"\\n\\nasked Tom, as he shoved the controller over another notch, and\\n\\ncaused the motor to make a higher note in its song of speed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, no, he was very nice about it,\" replied Mr. Damon. \"He\\n\\nsaid he hoped our bank would pull through. Said if we needed more\\n\\ncash we could have it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was nearly one o\\'clock, and they had the worst part of the\\n\\njourney yet to go. Thirty miles of stiff roads lay between them\\n\\nand Shopton, the last five and the first five being fairly good,\\n\\nwith, here and there, soft spots.\\n\\n\\n\\nUp hill and down went the electric auto. At every opportunity\\n\\nTom let out all the speed he could draw from the motor, but there\\n\\nwere many times when he had to slow down. He had just made the\\n\\nascent of a steep hill, and was turning into a fairly good road,\\n\\nskirting the edge of a steep cliff, when there came a sharp\\n\\nreport.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my soul! That\\'s a fuse, I\\'m sure of it!\" cried Mr.\\n\\nDamon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No,\" announced Tom, as he quickly shut off the power. \"It\\'s a\\n\\npuncture. One of the inner tubes of the tire has been pierced. I\\n\\nwas afraid of that tube.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What have you got to do; put on a new tire?\" asked Mr. Damon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, I\\'m going to put on a new wheel. I carry two spare ones\\n\\nwith tires all ready inflated. It won\\'t take long.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the process of changing wheels consumed more time than Tom\\n\\nanticipated for the nut was stuck, and he and Mr. Damon had to\\n\\nexert all their strength before they could loosen it. When the\\n\\nnew wheel was in place ten minutes had been lost.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hold on now, I\\'m going to speed her!\" cried Tom, when they\\n\\nwere once more in their seats, and speed the machine he did. The\\n\\nroad was rough, but despite this the lad turned on almost full\\n\\npower. Over the bumps they went, around curves and into rain-\\n\\nwashed ruts careening from side to side, and throwing Mr. Damon\\n\\nabout, as he expressed it afterward, \"like a bean inside of a\\n\\nfootball.\"  As for the young inventor his grasp of the steering\\n\\nwheel, and the manner in which he could brace himself against the\\n\\nfoot pedals, held him more firmly in place. On and on they\\n\\nrushed, covering mile after mile, and approaching Shopton where\\n\\nso much depended on their arrival.\\n\\n\\n\\nGood and bad stretches of the road alternated, but now that Tom\\n\\nhad seen of what mettle his car was made, he did not spare it as\\n\\nmuch as he had on the first trip. He saw that his machine would\\n\\nstand hard knocks, and the way the battery and motor was behaving\\n\\nwas a joy to him. He knew that if he could make that eighty-mile\\n\\nrun in safety he stood a good chance of winning the prize, for no\\n\\nharder test could have been devised.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the race was still far from won. There was a particularly\\n\\nunsafe stretch of road yet to be covered, and then would come a\\n\\nsmooth highway into Shopton.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ten miles more,\" observed Mr  Damon, snapping shut his big\\n\\ngold watch. \"Ten miles more, and it\\'s a quarter of two now. We\\n\\nought to be there at a quarter after, and that will be in good\\n\\ntime, eh, Tom?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I think so, but I don\\'t know about this piece of road we\\'re\\n\\ncoming to. It seems worse than when we passed over it this\\n\\nmorning.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAs he spoke the auto began to slow up, for the wheels had\\n\\nstruck some heavy sand, and it was necessary to reduce the\\n\\ncurrent. Tom turned back the controller handle, but watched with\\n\\neager eyes for a sign that the roadbed was harder, so that he\\n\\ncould increase speed.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the car turned around a curve, passing through a lonely\\n\\nstretch of country, with woods on either side of the highway, Tom\\n\\nglancing up, uttered a cry of astonishment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter; something gone wrong?\" asked his companion.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor answer Tom pointed. There, just ahead of them, was a big\\n\\nload of hay, and it was evident that the driver, was in no\\n\\nparticular hurry.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We can\\'t pass that without getting in over. our hubs!\" cried\\n\\nTom. \"If we turn out the side ditches are so soft that we\\'ll need\\n\\nhelp to pull out, and the road is so narrow for several miles\\n\\nthat we\\'ll have to trail along behind that fellow.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my check book!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"Are we going to lose,\\n\\nafter all, on account of a load of hay? No, I\\'ll buy it from him\\n\\nfirst, at double the market price, tip it over, set fire to it,\\n\\ntoss it in the ditch, and then we can go past!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Maybe that will answer,\" retorted Tom, smiling grimly.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe put on a little more speed, and was soon close up behind the\\n\\nload of hay, ringing his electric bell as a warning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I say!\" called Mr. Damon to the unseen driver, \"can\\'t you turn\\n\\nout and let us pass?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ha! Hum! Wa\\'al I guess not!\" came the answer, in unmistakable\\n\\nfarmer\\'s accents. \"You automobile fellers is too gol-hanged\\n\\nsmart, racin\\' along th\\' roads. I\\'ve got just as good a right here\\n\\nas you fellers have, by heck!\" The driver did not show himself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We know that,\" responded Tom, as quickly as he could, for he\\n\\ndid not want to anger the man. \"But our machine is so heavy that\\n\\nif we turn into the ditch I\\'m afraid we\\'ll be mired.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Huh! So\\'ll I,\" was the retort from the unseen driver.. \"Think\\n\\nI want t\\' spile my load of hay?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But you have wide tires on, and you wouldn\\'t sink in far,\"\\n\\nanswered the young inventor. \"Besides, it\\'s very necessary that\\n\\nwe get past. A great deal depends on our speed.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So it does on mine,\" was the reply. \"Ef I git t\\' market late\\n\\nI\\'ll have t\\' stay all night, an\\' spend money on a hotel bill.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll pay it! I\\'ll pay your bill if you\\'ll only pull out!\"\\n\\ncried Mr. Damon. \"I\\'ll give you a hundred dollars\\n\\n\\n\\nHe suddenly ceased speaking. From the bushes along the road\\n\\nsprang several ragged, masked figures. Each one, aiming his\\n\\nweapon at Tom, said in a low voice, that could not have been\\n\\nheard by the driver of the hay wagon:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Slow up your machine, young feller! We want to speak with you,\\n\\nand don\\'t you make a loud noise, or it won\\'t be healthy for you!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why of all the-!\" began Mr. Damon, but another of the footpads\\n\\nleveling his weapon at the eccentric man growled:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Dry up, if you don\\'t want to get shot!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Damon subsided. Discretion was very plainly the better part\\n\\nof valor. Tom had shut off the current. The load of hay continued\\n\\non ahead. Tom thought perhaps the driver of it might have been in\\n\\ncollusion with the thieves, to cause the auto to slow up.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What do you want with us?\" asked the young inventor, trying to\\n\\nspeak calmly, but finding it a hard task, with a revolver pointed\\n\\nat him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You know what we want,\" exclaimed the leader, in a low voice.\\n\\n\"We want that cash you got from the bank, and we\\'re going to have\\n\\nit! Come, now, shell out!\" and he advanced toward the automobile.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX                      ON TIME\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose around the electric auto crowded the members of the hold-\\n\\nup gang. Their eyes seemed to glare through the holes in their\\n\\nblack masks. Instantly Tom thought of the other occasion when he\\n\\nwas halted by masked figures. Could these, by any possibility, be\\n\\nthe same individuals? Was this a trick of Andy Foger and his\\n\\ncronies?\\n\\n\\n\\nTom tried to pierce through the disguises. Clearly the persons\\n\\nwere men--not boys--and they wore the ragged clothes of tramps.\\n\\nAlso, there was an air of dogged determination about them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, are you going to shell out?\" asked the leader, taking a\\n\\nstep nearer, \"or will we have to take it?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my very existence! You don\\'t mean to say that you\\'re\\n\\ngoing to take the money--I mean how do you know we have any\\n\\nmoney?\" and Mr. Damon hastily corrected himself. \"What right have\\n\\nyou to stop us in this way? Don\\'t you know that every minute\\n\\ncounts? We are in a hurry.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I know it,\" spoke the leading masked figure with a laugh. \"I\\n\\nknow you have considerable money in that shebang, and I know what\\n\\nyou hope to do with it, prevent the run on the Shopton National\\n\\nBank. But we need that money as much as some other people and,\\n\\nwhat\\'s more, we\\'re going to have it! Come on, shell out!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, why didn\\'t we bring a gun!\" lamented Mr. Damon in a low\\n\\nvoice to Tom. \"Isn\\'t there anything we can do? Can\\'t you give\\n\\nthem an electric shock, Tom?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid not. If it wasn\\'t for that hay wagon we could turn\\n\\non the current and make a run for it. But we\\'d only go into the\\n\\nditch if we tried to pass now.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe load of hay was down the road, but as Tom looked he noticed\\n\\na curious thing. It seemed to be nearer than it was when the\\n\\nattack of the masked men came. The wagon actually seemed to have\\n\\nbacked up. Once more the thought came to the lad that possibly\\n\\nthe load of fodder might be one of the factors on which the\\n\\nthieves counted. They might have used it to make the auto halt,\\n\\nand the man, or men, on it were probably in collusion with the\\n\\nfootpads. There was no doubt about it, the load of hay was coming\\n\\nnearer, backing up instead of moving away. Tom couldn\\'t\\n\\nunderstand it. He gave a swift glance at the robbers. They had\\n\\nnot appeared to notice this, or, if they had, they gave no sign.\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then we can\\'t do anything,\" murmured Mr. Damon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t see that we can,\" replied the young inventor in a low\\n\\nvoice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And the money we worked so hard to get won\\'t do the bank any\\n\\ngood,\" and Mr. Damon sighed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s tough luck,\" agreed Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Come now, fork over that cash!\" called the leader, advancing\\n\\nstill closer. \"None of that talk between you there. If you think\\n\\nyou can work some trick on us you\\'re mistaken. We\\'re desperate\\n\\nmen, and we\\'re well armed. The first show of resistance you make,\\n\\nand we shoot--get that, fellows?\" he added to his followers, and\\n\\nthey nodded grimly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" remarked Mr. Damon with an air of submission, \"I only\\n\\nwant to warn you that you are acting illegally, and that you are\\n\\nperpetrating a desperate crime.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, we know that all right,\" answered one of the men, and Tom\\n\\ngave a start. He was sure he had heard that voice before. He\\n\\ntried to remember it--tried to penetrate the disguise --but he\\n\\ncould not.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll give you ten seconds more to hand over that bag of\\n\\nmoney,\" went on the leader. \"If you don\\'t, we\\'ll take it and some\\n\\nof you may get hurt in the process.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThere seemed nothing else to do. With a white face, but with\\n\\nanger showing in his eyes Mr. Damon reached down to get the\\n\\nvalise. Tom had retained his grip of the steering wheel, and the\\n\\nstarting lever. He hoped, at the last minute, he might see a\\n\\nchance to dash away, and escape, but that load of hay was in the\\n\\npath. He noted that it was now quite near, but the thieves paid\\n\\nno attention to it.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom might have reversed the power, and sent his machine\\n\\nbackward, but he could not see to steer it if he went in that\\n\\ndirection, and he would soon have gone into the ditch. There was\\n\\nnothing to do save to hand over the cash, it seemed.\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Damon had the bag raised from the car, and the leader of\\n\\nthe thieves was reaching up for it, when there came a sudden\\n\\ninterruption.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom the load of hay there sounded a fusillade of pistol shots,\\n\\ncracking out with viciousness. This was instantly followed by the\\n\\nappearance of three men who came running from around the load of\\n\\nhay, down the road toward the thieves. Each man carried a\\n\\npitchfork, and as they ran, one of the trio shouted:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Right at \\'em, boys! Jab your hay forks clean through the\\n\\nscoundrels! By Heck, I guess we\\'ll show \\'em we know how t\\' tackle\\n\\na hold-up gang as well as the next fellow! Right at \\'em now!\\n\\nCharge \\'em! Stick your forks right through \\'em!\"  Again there\\n\\nsounded a fusillade of pistol shots.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe thieves turned as one man, and glanced at the relief so\\n\\nunexpectedly approaching. They gave one look at the three\\n\\ndetermined looking farmers, with their sharp, glittering\\n\\npitchforks, and then, without a word, they turned and fled,\\n\\nleaping into the bushes that lined the roadway. The underbrush\\n\\nclosed after them and they were hidden from sight.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn came the three farmers, waving their effective weapons, the\\n\\npistol shots still ringing out from the load of hay. Tom could\\n\\nnot understand it, and could see no one firing--could detect no\\n\\nsmoke.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Are they gone? Did they rob ye?\" asked the foremost of the\\n\\ntrio, a burly, grizzled farmer. Bust my buttons, but I guess we\\n\\nskeered \\'em all right!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my shoe buttons, but you certainly have!\" cried Mr.\\n\\nDamon, descending from the automobile, and wringing the hand of\\n\\nthe farmer, while Tom, thrust the bag of money under his legs and\\n\\nwaited further developments. The pistol shots rang out until one\\n\\nof the men called:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'ll do, Bub! We\\'ve skeered \\'em like Mrs. Zenoby\\'s pet cat!\\n\\nYou needn\\'t crack that whip any more.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Whip!\" cried Tom. \"Was that a whip?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s what it was,\" explained the leading farmer. \"Bub\\n\\nArmstrong, my nephew, can crack it to beat th\\' band,\" and as if\\n\\nin proof of this there emerged from behind the load of hay a\\n\\nsmall lad, carrying a large whip, to which he gave a few trial\\n\\ncracks, like pistol shots, as if to show his ability.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s all right, Bub,\" his uncle assured him. \"We made \\'em\\n\\nrun.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But I don\\'t exactly understand,\" spoke Mr. Damon. \"I thought\\n\\nyou were in league with those thieves, stopping us as you did\\n\\nwith your big load.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So did I,\" admitted Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ha! Ha!\" laughed the farmer. \"That\\'s a pretty good joke.\\n\\nExcuse me for laughin\\'. My name\\'s Lyon, Jethro Lyon, of Salina\\n\\nTownship, an\\' these is my two sons, Ade and Burt. You see we\\'re\\n\\non our way to Shopton, an\\' my nephew, Bub, he went along. We\\n\\nthought you was some of them sassy automobile fellers at first\\n\\nwhen you hollered to us you wanted to pass. Then when we looked\\n\\nback, we seen them burglars goin\\' t\\' rob you, at least that\\'s\\n\\nwhat we suspicioned,\" and he paused suggestively.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That was it,\" Tom said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Wa\\'al, when we seen that, we held a sort of consultation on\\n\\nthet load of hay, where they couldn\\'t see us. It was so big you\\n\\nknow,\" he needlessly explained. \"Wa\\'al, we calcalated we could\\n\\nhelp you, so I jest quietly backed up, until we was near enough.\\n\\nI told Bub to take the long whip, an\\' crack it for all he was\\n\\nwuth, so\\'s it would sound like reinforcements approachin\\' with\\n\\nguns, an\\' he done it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He certainly done it,\" added Burt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Wa\\'al,\" resumed Mr. Lyon, \"then me an my sons we jest slipped\\n\\ndown off the front seat, an\\' come a runnin\\' with our pitchforks.\\n\\nI reckoned them burglars would run when they see us an\\' heard us,\\n\\nan\\' they done so.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yep, they done so,\" added Ade, like an echo.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I can\\'t tell you how much obliged we are to you,\" said Mr.\\n\\nDamon. \"We have sixty thousand dollars in this valise, and they\\n\\nwould have had it in another minute, and the bank would have\\n\\nfailed.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Sixty thousand dollars!\" gasped Mr. Lyon, and his sons and\\n\\nnephew echoed the words. Mr. Damon briefly explained about the\\n\\nmoney, and he and the young inventor again thanked their\\n\\nrescuers, who had so unexpectedly, and in such a novel manner,\\n\\nput the thieves to flight.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"An\\' you\\'ve got t\\' git t\\' Shopton before three o\\'clock with\\n\\nthet cash?\" asked Mr. Lyon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s what we hoped to do,\" replied Tom \"but I\\'m afraid we\\n\\nwon\\'t now. It\\'s half past two, and\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Don\\'t say another word,\" interrupted Mr. Lyon. \"I know what ye\\n\\nmean. My hay\\'s in the road. But don\\'t let that worry ye none.\\n\\nI\\'ll pull out of your road in a jiffy, an\\' if we do go down in\\n\\nth\\' ditch, why we can throw off part of th\\' load, lighten th\\'\\n\\nwagon, an\\' pull out again. You\\'ve got t\\' hustle if ye git t\\'\\n\\nShopton by three o\\'clock.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I can do it with a clear road,\" declared Tom, confidently.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then ye\\'ll have th\\' clear road,\" Mr. Lyon assured him. \"Come\\n\\nboys, let\\'s git th\\' hay t\\' one side.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe farmers pulled into the ditch. As they had feared the wagon\\n\\nwent in almost to the hubs, but they did not mind, and, even as\\n\\nTom and Mr. Damon shot past them, they fell to work tossing off\\n\\npart of the fodder, to lighten the wagon. The young inventor and\\n\\nhis companion waved a grateful farewell to them as they fairly\\n\\ntore past, for Tom had turned on almost the full current.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Do you suppose that was the Happy Harry gang, or some members\\n\\nof it who were not captured and sent to jail?\" asked Mr. Damon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t believe so,\" answered the lad, shaking his head.\\n\\n\"Maybe they didn\\'t really want to rob us. Perhaps they only\\n\\nwanted to delay us so we wouldn\\'t get to the bank on time.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my top knot, you may be right!\" cried Mr. Damon.\\n\\n\\n\\nFurther conversation became difficult, as they struck a rough\\n\\npart of the road, where the vehicle swayed and jolted to an\\n\\nalarming degree. But Tom never slackened pace. On and on they\\n\\nrushed, Mr. Damon frequently looking at his watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We\\'ve got twenty minutes left,\" he remarked as they came out\\n\\non the smooth stretch of road, that led directly into Shopton.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen Tom turned all the reserve power into the motor. The\\n\\nmachinery almost groaned as the current surged into the wires,\\n\\nbut it took up the load, and the electric car, swaying more than\\n\\never, dashed ahead with its burden of wealth.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow they were in the town, now speeding down the street leading\\n\\nto the bank. One or two policemen shouted after them, for they\\n\\nwere violating the speed laws, but it was no time to stop for\\n\\nthat. On and on they dashed.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey came in sight of the bank. A long line of persons was\\n\\nstill in front. They seemed more excited than in the morning, for\\n\\nthe hour of three was approaching, and they feared the bank would\\n\\nclose its doors, never to open them again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The run is still on,\" observed Mr. Damon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But it will soon be over,\" predicted Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome news of the errand of the automobile must have penetrated\\n\\nthe crowd, for as Tom swung past the front entrance to the bank,\\n\\nto go up the rear alley, he was greeted with a cheer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"They\\'re got the cash!\" a man cried. \"I\\'m satisfied now. I\\n\\ndon\\'t draw out my deposit.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I want to see the cash before I\\'ll believe it,\" said another.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom slowed up to make the turn into the alley. As he did so he\\n\\nglanced across the street to the new bank. In the window stood\\n\\nAndy Foger and his father. There was a look of surprise on their\\n\\nfaces as they saw the arrival of the powerful car, and, Tom\\n\\nfancied, also a look of chagrin.\\n\\n\\n\\nUp the alley went the car, police keeping the crowd from\\n\\nfollowing. The porter was at the door. So, also, was Mr.\\n\\nPendergast and Mr. Swift, while some of the other officers were\\n\\ngrouped behind them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Did you get the money?\" gasped the president.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We did,\" answered Tom. \"Are we on time, Dad?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Just on time, my boy! They\\'re paying out the last of the cash\\n\\nnow! You\\'re on time, thank fortune!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI             OFF TO THE BIG RACE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom their task of handing out money to eager depositors, the\\n\\nwearied tellers looked up as Tom and Mr. Damon entered with the\\n\\nbig valise crammed full of money. It was opened, and the bundles\\n\\nof bills turned out on a table.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Perhaps you\\'d better make an announcement to the crowd, Mr.\\n\\nPendergast,\" suggested Mr. Swift. \"Tell them we now have cash\\n\\nenough to meet all demands, and that the bank will be kept open\\n\\nuntil every one is paid.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I will,\" agreed the aged president. His announcement was\\n\\nreceived with cheers, and had exactly the effect the inventor\\n\\nhoped it would.\\n\\n\\n\\nMany, learning that the bank was safe, and that they could have\\n\\ntheir money whenever they wanted it, concluded not to withdraw\\n\\nit, thus saving the interest. Scores in the waiting crowd turned\\n\\nout of line and went home. Their example was contagious, and,\\n\\nthough many still remained to get their deposits, the run was\\n\\nbroken. Only part of the sixty thousand dollars Tom and Mr. Damon\\n\\nhad brought through after a race with time, was needed. But had\\n\\nit not been for the moral effect of the cash arriving as it did,\\n\\nthe bank would have failed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You have a great car, Tom Swift,\" complimented Mr. Pendergast,\\n\\nwhen the excitement had somewhat cooled down, and the story of\\n\\nthe hold-up had been told.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I think so myself,\" agreed the young inventor modestly. \"I\\n\\nmust get ready for the races now.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"And as for those farmers, I think I\\'ll send them a reward,\"\\n\\nwent on the president. \"They deserve something for the trouble\\n\\nthey had with the load of hay. I certainly shall send them a\\n\\nreward,\" which he did, and a substantial one, too.\\n\\n\\n\\nOf course the hold-up was at once reported to the police after\\n\\nthe run had quieted down, but Chief Simonson surprised Tom by\\n\\nsaying that he had expected it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The gang that held you up,\" said the police officer, \"was one\\n\\nthat escaped from a jail, about twenty miles away. I got a tip\\n\\nafter you left, that they were going to rob you, for, in some\\n\\nway, they learned about the money you and Mr. Damon were to bring\\n\\nfrom the bank. The unfortunate part of it was that the tip I got\\n\\nwas to the effect that the hold-up would take place just outside\\n\\nof Clayton. I telephoned to the police there, just after you\\n\\nleft, and they said they\\'d send out a posse. But the gang changed\\n\\ntheir plans; and held you up near here, where I wasn\\'t expecting\\n\\nit. But I\\'ll get \\'em yet.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nChief Simonson did not arrest the gang, but some other police\\n\\nofficers did, and they were taken back to jail. They were not\\n\\nprosecuted for the attempted robbery of Tom, as it was considered\\n\\ndifficult to fix the guilt on them, but they received such a long\\n\\nadditional sentence for breaking jail, that it will be many years\\n\\nbefore they are released.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Tom reached home that night he found some mail from the\\n\\nofficials of the Touring Club of America. It was to the effect\\n\\nthat arrangements for the big contest had been completed, and\\n\\nthat contesting cars must be on the ground by September first.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That gives me two weeks yet,\" thought our hero.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe read further of the regulations covering the race. Each car\\n\\nmust proceed from the home town or city of the owner, and go to\\n\\nthe track under its own power. This was a new regulation, it was\\n\\nstated, and was adopted to better develop the industry of\\n\\nbuilding electric autos. Two passengers, or one in addition to\\n\\nthe driver, must be carried, it was stated, and this one would\\n\\nalso be expected to be in the car during the entire race.\\n\\n\\n\\nRegarding the race proper it was stated that at first it had\\n\\nbeen decided to make it a twenty-four hour endurance contest, but\\n\\nthat for certain reasons this was changed, as it was found that\\n\\nfew storage batteries could go this length of time without a\\n\\nnumber of rechargings. Therefore the race was to be one for\\n\\ndistance--five hundred miles, on the new Long Island track, and\\n\\nthe car first covering that distance would win. Cars were allowed\\n\\nto change their batteries as often as they needed to, but all\\n\\ntime lost would count against them. There were other rules and\\n\\nregulations of minor importance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" remarked Tom, as he read through the circulars, \"I must\\n\\nget my car in shape. It will be quite a tip to Long Island, and I\\n\\nthink my best plan will be to go direct to the cottage we had\\n\\nwhen we were building the submarine, and from there proceed to\\n\\nthe track. That will comply with the rules, I think. But who will\\n\\nI get to go with me? I suppose Mr. Damon or Mr. Sharp will be\\n\\nwilling. I\\'ll ask them.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe broached the matter to his two friends that night, and they\\n\\nboth agreed to go to Long Island in the car, though only Mr.\\n\\nSharp would accompany Tom in the race. The next two weeks were\\n\\nbusy ones for Tom. He worked night and day over his car, getting\\n\\nit in shape for the big event.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe young inventor made some changes in his battery, and also\\n\\nadopted a new gear, which would give greater speed. He also\\n\\ncompleted the exterior of the auto, giving it several coats of\\n\\npurple paint and varnish, so that when it was finished, though it\\n\\nwas different in shape from most autos, it was as fine an\\n\\nappearing car as one could wish. He arranged to carry two extra\\n\\nwheels, with tires inflated, and, under the rear seats, or\\n\\ntonneau, as he called it, Tom fitted up a complete tire-repairing\\n\\noutfit. Mr. Sharp agreed to ride there, and in case there was\\n\\nneed to use more than two spare wheels during the race, the\\n\\nrubber shoes or inner tubes could be mended while the car was\\n\\nswinging around the track.\\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Damon would ride in front with Tom on the cross-country\\n\\ntrip, and occasionally relieve him at steering, or would help to\\n\\nmanage the electrical connections. Spare fuses, extra parts,\\n\\nwires and different things he thought he might need, the young\\n\\ninventor stored in his car. He also found means to install a\\n\\nsmall additional storage battery, to give added power in case of\\n\\nemergency.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom learned from the racing officials that if he made a trip\\n\\nfrom Shopton to the cottage on the coast, near the city of\\n\\nAtlantis, and later traveled from there to the track, it would\\n\\nfulfill the conditions of the contest.\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally all was in readiness, and one morning, having spent the\\n\\nbetter part of the night going over his machine, to see that he\\n\\nhad forgotten nothing, Tom invited Mr. Damon and Mr. Sharp to\\n\\nenter, and prepare for the trip to Long Island.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, Tom, I certainly hope you win that race,\" remarked Mrs.\\n\\nBaggert, as she stood in the doorway, waving a farewell.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If I do I\\'ll buy you a pair of diamond earrings to match the\\n\\ndiamond ring I gave you from the money I got from the wreck,\"\\n\\npromised the lad with a laugh.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"An\\' ef yo\\' sees dat Andy Foger,\" added Eradicate Sampson,\\n\\nwhile he rubbed the long ears of Boomerang, his mule, \"ef yo\\'\\n\\nsees him, jest run ober him once or twice fer mah sake, Mistah\\n\\nSwift.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll do it for my own, too,\" agreed Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe youth shook hands with his father, who wished him good\\n\\nluck, and then, after a final look at his car, he climbed to his\\n\\nseat, and turned on the power. There was a low hum from the motor\\n\\nand the electric started off. Would it return a winner or loser\\n\\nof the big race?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII                    IN A DITCH\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThrough the streets of Shopton went Tom Swift and his friends.\\n\\nNews of the big contest the young inventor was about to take part\\n\\nin, had circulated around town, and there were not wanting many\\n\\nto wish him good luck. The lad responded smilingly to the\\n\\nfarewells he received. As they passed the bank, Ned Newton came\\n\\nout on the steps.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Wish I was going along,\" he called.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So do I,\" replied Tom. \"How\\'s everything? Is the bank all\\n\\nright since the run?\" for he had not had time to pay much\\n\\nattention to the institution since his memorable race against\\n\\ntime, to get the money.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Stronger and better than ever,\" was Ned\\'s answer, as he came\\n\\nto the curb, where Tom slowed up. \"I hear,\" he added in a\\n\\nwhisper, \"that the other fellows are going out of business--Foger\\n\\nand his crowd you know. They loaned money on unsecured notes to\\n\\nmake a good showing, and now they can\\'t get it back But we\\'re all\\n\\nright. Hope you win the race.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So do I.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What will a certain person do while you\\'re away?\" went on Ned,\\n\\nwith a wink.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know what you mean,\" replied Tom, trying not to blush.\\n\\n\"Do you mean my dad or Mrs. Baggert?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Neither, you old hypocrite you! I meant Miss Mary Nestor.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, hadn\\'t you heard?\" inquired Tom innocently. \"She is going\\n\\nto Long Island to visit some friends, and she\\'ll be at the race.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You lucky dog,\" murmured Ned with a laugh, as he went into the\\n\\nbank.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce more the electric auto started off, and was soon on the\\n\\nquiet country road, where Tom speeded it up moderately. He hoped\\n\\nto be able to make the entire distance to the shore cottage on\\n\\nthe single charge of current he had put into the battery at home,\\n\\nand, as there was no special need for haste, he wanted to save\\n\\nhis power. The machine was running smoothly, and seemed able to\\n\\nmake a long race against time\\n\\n\\n\\nThe travelers ate lunch that day at Pendleton, a town some\\n\\ndistance from Shopton. They had covered a substantial part of\\n\\ntheir trip. After a brief rest they started on again. Tom had\\n\\nplanned to spend two days and one night on the road, hoping to be\\n\\nable to reach the shore cottage on the evening of the second day.\\n\\nThere, after recharging the battery, he would spend a night, or\\n\\ntwo, and proceed to the track, ready for the race.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey found the roads fairly good, with bad stretches here and\\n\\nthere, which made it necessary for them to slow down. This\\n\\ndelayed them, and they found the shadows lengthening, and\\n\\ndarkness approaching, when they were still several miles from\\n\\nBurgfield, where they intended to sleep.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Will it be all right to travel at night?\" asked Mr. Damon, a\\n\\nbit nervously.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why, are you thinking of hold-up men?\" inquired Mr. Sharp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, but I was wondering about the condition of the roads,\"\\n\\nreplied the eccentric man. \"We don\\'t want to run into a rock, or\\n\\ncollide with something.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I guess this will light up the road far enough in advance, so\\n\\nthat we can see where we are going,\" suggested Tom, as he\\n\\nswitched on the powerful electric search-light. Though it was not\\n\\ndark enough to illuminate the highway to the best advantage, the\\n\\npowerful gleam shone dazzlingly in front of the swiftly moving\\n\\nauto.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I guess that will show up every pebble in the road,\" commented\\n\\nthe balloonist. It\\'s very powerful.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom turned off the light, as, until it was darker, he could see\\n\\nto better advantage unaided by it. He slowed down the speed\\n\\nsomewhat, but was still going at a good rate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There\\'s a bridge somewhere about here,\" remarked the lad, when\\n\\nthey had gone on a mile further. I remember seeing it on my road\\n\\nmap. It\\'s not very strong, and we\\'ll have to run slow over it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my gizzard, I hope we don\\'t go through it!\" cried Mr.\\n\\nDamon. \"Is your car very heavy, Tom?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not heavy enough to break the bridge. Ah, there it is. Guess\\n\\nI\\'ll turn on the light so we can see what we\\'re doing.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nJust ahead of them loomed up the super-structure of a bridge,\\n\\nand Tom turned the searchlight switch. At the instant he did so,\\n\\nwhether he did not keep a steady hand on the steering wheel, or\\n\\nwhether the auto went into a rut from which it could not be\\n\\nturned, did not immediately develop, but the car suddenly shot\\n\\nfrom the straight road, and swerved to one side. There was a\\n\\nlurch, and the front wheels sank down.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Look out! We\\'re going into the river!\" yelled Mr. Damon.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom jammed on the brakes and shut off the current. The auto\\n\\ncame to a sudden stop. The young inventor turned the searchlight\\n\\ndownward, to illuminate the ground directly in front of the car.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Are we in the river?\" asked Mr. Sharp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No,\" replied Tom in great chagrin. \"We\\'re in a muddy ditch.\\n\\nOne at the side of the road. Wheels in over the hubs! There\\n\\nshould have been a guard rail here. We\\'re stuck for fair!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIII                   THE POWER GONE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my overshoes!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"Stuck in the mud, eh?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Hard and fast,\" added Tom, in disgust.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s to be done?\" inquired Mr. Sharp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I should say we\\'ll have to stay here until daylight, and wait\\n\\nfor some other auto to come along and pull us out,\" was Mr.\\n\\nDamon\\'s opinion. \"It\\'s might unpleasant, too, for there doesn\\'t\\n\\nseem to be any place around here where we can spend the night in\\n\\nany kind of comfort. If we had the submarine or the airship, now,\\n\\nit wouldn\\'t so much matter.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, and this won\\'t matter a great deal,\" remarked the young\\n\\ninventor quickly. \"We\\'ll soon be out of this, but it will be hard\\n\\nwork.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Mr. Sharp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I mean that we\\'ve got to pull ourselves out of this mud hole,\"\\n\\nexplained the lad, as he prepared to descend. \"I was afraid\\n\\nsomething like this would happen, so I came prepared for it. I\\'ve\\n\\ngot ropes and pulleys with me, in the car. We\\'ll fasten the rope\\n\\nto the machine, attach one pulley to the bridge, another to the\\n\\ncar, and I guess we can get out of the mud. We\\'ll try, anyhow.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I must say you looked pretty far ahead,\" complimented\\n\\nMr. Damon.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom a box under the tonneau Tom took out a thin but strong\\n\\nrope and two compound pulleys, which would enable considerable\\n\\nforce to be applied. Mr. Sharp detached one of the powerful oil\\n\\nlamps, and the three travelers took a look at the auto. It was\\n\\nindeed deep in the mud and it seemed like a hopeless task to try\\n\\nto get it out unaided. But Tom insisted that they could do it,\\n\\nand the rope was soon attached, the hook of one pulley being\\n\\nslipped around one of the braces of the bridge.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Now, all together!\" cried the lad, as he and his friends\\n\\ngrasped the long rope. They gave a great heave. At first it\\n\\nseemed like pulling on a stone wall. The rope strained and the\\n\\npulleys creaked.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I--guess--we--will--pull--the--bridge--over!\" gasped Mr.\\n\\nSharp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Something\\'s got to give way!\" puffed Tom. \"Now, once more! All\\n\\ntogether!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly they felt the rope moving. The pulleys creaked still\\n\\nmore and, by the light of the lamp, they could see that the auto\\n\\nwas slowly being pulled backward, out of the mud, and onto the\\n\\nhard road. In a few minutes it was ready to proceed again.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe rope and pulleys were put away, and, after Tom had made an\\n\\nexamination of the car to see that it had sustained no damage,\\n\\nthey were off again, making good time to the hotel in Burgfield,\\n\\nwhere they spent the night. They had an early breakfast, and, as\\n\\nTom went out to the barn to look at his car, he saw it surrounded\\n\\nby a curious throng of men and boys. One of the boys was turning\\n\\nsome of the handles and levers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Here! Quit that!\" yelled Tom, and the meddlesome lad leaped\\n\\ndown in fright. \"Do you want to start the car and have it smash\\n\\ninto something?\" demanded the young inventor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Aw, nothin\\' happened,\" retorted the lad. \"I pulled every\\n\\nhandle on it, an\\' it didn\\'t move.\\'~\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Good reason,\" murmured Tom, for he had taken the precaution to\\n\\nremove a connecting plug, without which the machine could not be\\n\\nstarted.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe three were soon under way again, and covered many miles\\n\\nover the fine country roads, the weather conditions being\\n\\ndelightful. On inquiry they found that by taking an infrequently\\n\\nused highway, they could save several miles. It was over an\\n\\nunoccupied part of country, rather wild and desolate, but they\\n\\ndid not mind that.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey were whizzing along, talking of Tom\\'s chances for winning\\n\\nthe race when, after climbing a slight grade, the auto came to a\\n\\nsudden stop on the summit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" asked Mr. Sharp. \"Why are you stopping\\n\\nhere, Tom?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t stop,\" was the surprising answer, and the lad shoved\\n\\nthe starting lever back and forth.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut there was no response. There was no hum from the motor. The\\n\\nmachine was \"dead.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s queer,\" murmured the young inventor\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Maybe a fuse blew out,\" suggested Mr. Damon, that seeming to\\n\\nbe his favorite form of trouble.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If it had you\\'d have known it,\" remarked Mr. Sharp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There\\'s plenty of current in the battery, according to the\\n\\nregistering gauge, murmured the lad. \"I can\\'t understand it.\"  He\\n\\nreversed the current, thinking the wires might have become\\n\\ncrossed, but the machine would move neither backward nor forward,\\n\\nyet the dial indicated that there was enough power stored away to\\n\\nsend it a hundred miles or more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Perhaps the dial hand has become caught,\" suggested Mr. Sharp.\\n\\n\"That sometimes happens on a steam gauge, and indicates a high\\n\\npressure when there isn\\'t any. Hit it slightly, and see if the\\n\\nhand swings back.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom did so. At once the hand fell to zero, indicating that\\n\\nthere was not an ampere of current left. The battery was\\n\\nexhausted, but this fact had not been indicated on the gauge.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I see now!\" cried Tom. \"It was those fellows at the hotel\\n\\nbarn! They monkeyed with the mechanism, short circuited the\\n\\nbattery, and jammed the gauge so I couldn\\'t tell when my power\\n\\nwas gone. If I had known there wasn\\'t enough to carry us I could\\n\\nhave recharged the battery at the hotel. But I figured that I had\\n\\nenough current for the entire trip, and so there would have been,\\n\\nif it hadn\\'t leaked away. Now we\\'re in a pretty pickle.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Bless my hat band!\" cried Mr. Damon. \"Does that mean we can\\'t\\n\\nmove?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Guess that\\'s about it,\" answered Mr. Sharp, and Tom nodded.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Well, why can\\'t we go on to some place where they sell\\n\\nelectricity, and get enough to take us where we want to go?\"\\n\\nasked the odd character, whose ideas of machinery were somewhat\\n\\nhazy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The only trouble is we can\\'t carry the heavy car with us,\"\\n\\nreplied Tom. \"It\\'s too big to pick up and take to a charging\\n\\nstation.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Then we\\'ve got to wait until some one comes along with a team\\n\\nof horses, and tows us in,\" commented Mr. Sharp. \"And that will\\n\\nbe some time, on this lonely road.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTom shook his head despondently. He went all over the car\\n\\nagain, but was forced to the first conclusion, that the reserve\\n\\ncurrent had leaked away, in consequence of the meddling prank of\\n\\nthe youth at the hotel. The situation was far from pleasant, and\\n\\nthe delay would seriously interfere with their plans.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly, as Tom was pacing up and down the road, he heard from\\n\\nafar, a peculiar humming sound. He paused to listen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Trolley car,\" observed Mr. Sharp. \"Maybe one of us could go\\n\\nsomewhere on the trolley and get help. There it is,\" and he\\n\\npointed to the electric vehicle, moving along about half a mile\\n\\naway, at the foot of a gentle slope.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the sight of the car Tom uttered a cry. \"I have it!\" he\\n\\nexclaimed. \"None of us need go for help! It\\'s right at hand!\"\\n\\nHis companions looked curiously, as the young inventor pointed\\n\\ntriumphantly to the fast disappearing electric.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIV                        ON THE TRACK\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Mr. Damon. \"Will the electric trolley\\n\\npull us to a charging station?\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No, we\\'ll not need to go to a station,\" answered the youth.\\n\\n\"If we can get my car to the trolley tracks I can charge my\\n\\nbattery from there. And I think we can push the auto near enough.\\n\\nIt\\'s down hill, and I\\'ve got a long wire so we won\\'t have to go\\n\\ntoo close.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Good!\" cried Mr. Sharp. \"But attach the rope to the front of\\n\\nthe car, Tom. Mr. Damon and I will pull it. You\\'ll have to ride\\n\\nin it to steer it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We can take turns at riding,\" was Tom\\'s answer, for he did not\\n\\nwant his companions to do all the work.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Nonsense! You ride,\" said Mr. Damon. \"You\\'re lighter than we\\n\\nare, and can steer better. It won\\'t be any trouble at all to pull\\n\\nthis car down hill.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIt proved to be an easy task, and in a short time the \"dead\"\\n\\nauto was near enough to the electric line to permit Tom to run\\n\\nhis charging wire over to it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why bless my soul!\" exclaimed Mr. Damon, looking up. \"There\\'s\\n\\nno overhead trolley wire. The car must run on storage batteries.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Third rail, more likely,\" was the opinion of Mr. Sharp and so\\n\\nit proved.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I can charge from either the third rail or the trolley wire,\"\\n\\ndeclared Tom, who was insulating his hands in rubber gloves, and\\n\\ngetting his wires ready. In a short time he had the proper\\n\\nconnections made, and the much-needed current was soon flowing\\n\\ninto the depleted battery, or batteries, for there were several\\n\\nsets, though the whole source of motive power was usually\\n\\nreferred to as a \"storage battery.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"How long will it take?\" asked Mr. Damon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"About two hours,\" answered the lad. \"We\\'ll probably have to\\n\\ndisconnect our wires several times, whenever a trolley car comes\\n\\npast. By my system I can recharge the battery very quickly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Do you suppose the owners of the road will make any\\n\\nobjection?\" asked the balloonist.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m going to pay for the current I use,\" explained the young\\n\\ninventor. \"I have a meter which tells how much I take.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe hum of an approaching car was heard, and Tom took the wires\\n\\nfrom the third rail. The car came to a stop opposite the\\n\\nautomobile, the passengers, as well as the crew, looking\\n\\ncuriously at the queer racing machine. Tom explained to the\\n\\nconductor what was going on, and asked the fare-collector to\\n\\nnotify those in charge of the power station that all current used\\n\\nwould be paid for. The conductor said this would be satisfactory,\\n\\nhe was sure, and the car proceeded, Tom resuming the charging of\\n\\nhis battery.\\n\\n\\n\\nAllowing plenty of reserve power to accumulate, and making sure\\n\\nthat the gauge would not stick again, and deceive him, the owner\\n\\nof the speedy electric was soon ready to proceed again. They had\\n\\nbeen delayed a little over three hours, for they had to make\\n\\nseveral shifts, as the cars came past.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey reached their shore cottage late that night, and, after\\n\\nseeing that the runabout was safely locked in the big shed where\\n\\nthe submarine had been built, they all went to bed, for they were\\n\\nvery tired.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom sent word, the next day, to the managers of the race, that\\n\\nhe would be on hand at the time stipulated, and announced that he\\n\\nhad made part of the trip, as required, under the power of the\\n\\nauto itself.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next day was spent in overhauling the machinery, tightening\\n\\nup some loose bearings, oiling different parts, and further\\n\\ncharging the battery. Tires were looked to, and the ones on the\\n\\nspare wheels were gone over to prepare for any emergency that\\n\\nmight arise when the race was started.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the third day, Tom, Mr. Sharp and Mr. Damon, leaving the\\n\\ncottage completed the trip to Havenford, Long Island, where the\\n\\nnew track had been constructed.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey reached the place shortly before noon, and, if they had\\n\\nbeen unaware of the location they could not have missed it, for\\n\\nthere were many autos speeding along the road toward the scene of\\n\\nthe race, which would take place the following day.\\n\\n\\n\\nSeveral electric cars passed Tom and his friends, whizzing\\n\\nswiftly by, but the young inventor was not going to show off his\\n\\nspeed until the time came. Besides, he did not want to run any\\n\\nrisks of an accident. But some of the contestants seemed anxious\\n\\nfor impromptu \"brushes,\" and more than one called to our hero to\\n\\n\"speed up and let\\'s see what she can do.\" But Tom smiled, and\\n\\nshook his head.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere were many gasolene and some steam autos going out to the\\n\\nnew track, which was considered a remarkable piece of\\n\\nengineering. It was in the shape of an octagon, and the turns\\n\\nwere considered very safe. It was a five mile track, and to\\n\\ncomplete the race it would be necessary to make a hundred\\n\\ncircuits.\\n\\n\\n\\nThrough scores of autos Tom and his friends threaded their way,\\n\\nthe young inventor keeping a watchful eye on the various types of\\n\\nmachine with which he would soon have to compete.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere were many kinds. Some were larger and some smaller than\\n\\nhis. Many obviously carried very large batteries, but whether\\n\\nthey had the speed or not was another question. Some, in spurts,\\n\\nseemed to Tom, to be fully as fast as his own, and he began to\\n\\nhave some doubts whether he would win the race.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But I\\'m not going to give up until the five hundredth mile is\\n\\nfinished,\" he thought, grimly.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey were now in sight of the track, and noted many machines\\n\\nspeeding around it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Go on in and try your car, Tom,\" urged Mr. Sharp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, do,\" added Mr. Damon. \"Let\\'s see how it travels.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I will, after I notify the proper officials that I have\\n\\narrived,\" decided the lad.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe formalities were soon complied with. Tom received his entry\\n\\ncard, after paying the fee, made affidavit that he had completed\\n\\nthe entire trip from home under his own power, save for the\\n\\nlittle stretch when the car was pulled, which did not count\\n\\nagainst him, and was soon ready to go on the track. Only electric\\n\\ncars were allowed there.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the young inventor guided his latest effort in the machine\\n\\nline onto the big track there were murmurs of surprise from the\\n\\nthrongs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s a queer machine,\" said one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, but it looks speedy,\" was another\\'s opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"There\\'s the car for my money,\" added a third, pointing to a\\n\\nbig red electric which was certainly whizzing around the track.\\n\\nTom noted the red car. Behind it was a green one, also moving at\\n\\na fast rate of speed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Those will be my nearest rivals,\" thought the lad, as he\\n\\nguided his car onto the track. A moment later he was sending the\\n\\nauto ahead at moderate speed, while the other contestants looked\\n\\nat the new arrival, as if trying to discover whether in it they\\n\\nwould have a dangerous competitor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXV             WINNING THE PRIZE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter making two circuits of the track at moderate speed, Tom\\n\\nturned on more power, deciding to see how the machine would\\n\\nbehave on the turns, going at a fast speed. As it happened he\\n\\nforged ahead just as the big red car was coming up behind him.\\n\\nThe driver of it took this for a challenge and threw his\\n\\ncontroller handle forward.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Come on!\" he cried to our hero, when even with him.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom did not want to decline the invitation, and the impromptu\\n\\nrace was under way. Soon the green car came rushing up, and for\\n\\ntwo miles the three kept almost in line. It was evident that\\n\\nneither the green nor the red car drivers wanted to \"open out,\"\\n\\nuntil they saw Tom do so.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was willing to oblige them, and suddenly increased his\\n\\nspeed. They did the same, and went ahead of him. Then Tom turned\\n\\non a little more juice and got the lead, but the two men were\\n\\nright after him, and they see-sawed like this for two more miles.\\n\\nThen, with a cry the man in the red car, with a sudden burst of\\n\\nspeed, left Tom and the green car behind. The green car was soon\\n\\nup to its rival, but Tom decided he would not spurt.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe lad and his friends spent the early part of the night in\\n\\nmaking a final inspection of the machinery, finding it in good\\n\\norder. Then, with his head filled with visions of the race on the\\n\\nmorrow Tom went to bed. He had made inquiries, by telephone, of\\n\\nthe friends of Miss Nestor, and learned that she had not arrived.\\n\\nTom felt a distinct sense of disappointment.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe day of the race could not have been better. It was ideal\\n\\nweather, and conditions at the track were just right. Tom was up\\n\\nearly, and went over every inch of his car with a nervous dread\\n\\nthat he might find something the matter.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe final details of the race were completed, and the entrants\\n\\ngiven their numbers and places. Tom drew a good position, not the\\n\\nbest, but he had no reason to complain. Half an hour before the\\n\\nstart he again telephoned to see if Miss Nestor had arrived, but\\n\\nshe had not, and it was with rather gloomy thoughts that the lad\\n\\nentered his car, in which Mr. Sharp had already taken his place.\\n\\nMr. Damon went to the grandstand to watch the race.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I wanted Mary to see me win,\" thought our hero, for he had\\n\\ngrimly set his mind on coming in ahead.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was a great crowd in the grandstand and scattered about\\n\\nthe big track, which took in a large extent of territory. In\\n\\nspite of its size--five  miles  around--it  seemed  solidly\\n\\npacked for the entire length with autos, containing gay parties\\n\\nwho had come to see the electric contest. There was a band\\n\\nplaying gay airs, as Tom guided his machine through the entrance\\n\\ngate, and onto the track.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe judges made their final inspection. There were twenty cars\\n\\nentered, but it was obvious that some of them would not last\\n\\nlong, as their battery capacity was not large enough. Their\\n\\nowners might have relied on recharging, but how they could do\\n\\nthis under the usual slow system, and hope to win, Tom could not\\n\\nsee. He hoped to run the entire distance on the single charge,\\n\\nbut, if by some accident part of his current should leak away,\\n\\nhis battery could be charged in a short time, by means of his new\\n\\nsystem, to run for a considerable distance, or he could install a\\n\\nnew one already charged, for he had two sets on hand. Tom glanced\\n\\nover the cars of his competitors. They were to be sent away in\\n\\nbatches, the affair being a handicap one, with time allowance for\\n\\nthe smaller powered cars. Tom noted that his car and the red and\\n\\nthe green ones were in the same bunch. Tom\\'s car was purple.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Are you all ready?\" asked the starter of the first group of\\n\\nraces.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Ready,\" was the low-voiced response.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Crack!\" went the pistol, and there followed the hum of the\\n\\nmotors as the current set the mechanism to work. Forward went the\\n\\ncars, amid the crash of the band and the cheers of the crowd. The\\n\\nbig race was under way.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Do you feel nervous, Tom?\" asked Mr. Sharp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Not a bit,\" replied the lad.\\n\\n\\n\\nAround and around the track flew the speedy electrics. It was\\n\\nevident that the holding of a meet solely for cars of  this\\n\\ncharacter had brought out many new ideas that would be to the\\n\\nbenefit of the industry. Some cars were \"freaks\" and others, like\\n\\nTom\\'s, showed a distinct advance over previous styles of\\n\\nconstruction.\\n\\n\\n\\nA five-hundred mile race around a track is rather a monotonous\\n\\naffair, except for what happens, and things very soon began to\\n\\nhappen at this race.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs Tom had expected, several of the machines were forced to\\n\\nwithdraw. Tire troubles beset some, and others found that they\\n\\nwere hopelessly out of it because of low power, or lack of\\n\\nbattery capacity.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom determined not to let the red or the green car gain any\\n\\nadvantage over him, and so he watched those two vehicles\\n\\nnarrowly. On the other hand, the red and the green electrics were\\n\\nevidently afraid of one another and of Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey all three kept pretty much together for the first thirty\\n\\nmiles. By this time the race had settled down into a steady\\n\\ngrind. There was some excitement when the steering gear of one\\n\\ncar broke, and it crashed Into the fence, injuring the driver,\\n\\nbut the race went on.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe young inventor was holding his own with his two chief\\n\\nrivals, and was feeling rather proud of his car, when there came\\n\\nfrom it a report like a pistol shot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Blow out!\" yelled Tom desperately, steering to one of the\\n\\nseveral repair stations on the inner side of the track. \"Be ready\\n\\nwith the extra wheel, Mr. Sharp!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Right you are!\" cried the balloonist. The car was scarcely\\n\\nstopped when he had leaped out, and had the lifting jack under\\n\\nthe left rear wheel, where the tire had gone to the bad. He and\\n\\nTom labored like Trojans to take off the wheel, and put on the\\n\\nother. They lost five minutes, and when they got under way again\\n\\nthe red and the green cars were three quarters of a lap ahead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'ve got to catch them!\" declared Sharp firmly.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the red and the green car drivers saw their advantage, and\\n\\nwere determined to hold it. Tom could not catch them without\\n\\ngoing his limit, and he did not want to do this just yet.\\n\\nHowever, he had his opportunity when about two hundred miles had\\n\\nbeen covered. Both the red and the green cars had tire troubles,\\n\\nbut the red one was delayed scarcely two minutes as there was a\\n\\ncorps of mechanics on hand to take off the defective wheel and\\n\\nput on another. Still Tom regained his lost ground, and once more\\n\\nthe race between those three cars was even.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the rear of Tom\\'s car Mr. Sharp was mending the blown-out\\n\\ntire, though there was still one spare wheel on reserve. Tom, in\\n\\nfront, peered eagerly at the track. Nearly side by side raced the\\n\\nred and the green cars, the latter somewhat to the rear.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was at the three hundred and fiftieth mile that Tom had\\n\\nanother blow-out. This time it took a little longer to change the\\n\\nwheel, and the red and green cars gained a full lap on him. The\\n\\ntrack was now so dusty that it was difficult to see the\\n\\ncontesting cars. Many had dropped out, and more were on the verge\\n\\nof giving up.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith the odds against him, Tom started in to regain the lost\\n\\nground. Narrowly he watched his electric power. Slowly he saw it\\n\\ndropping. Would he have enough left to finish out the race? He\\n\\nfeared not. The hours were passing. Still there was a hundred\\n\\nmiles yet to go twenty circuits of the track. Some of the\\n\\nspectators were getting weary and leaving. The band played\\n\\nspasmodically.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuddenly Tom saw the red car shoot to one side of the track,\\n\\ntoward a charging station; The green car followed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s our cue!\" cried the young inventor \"We need a little\\n\\nmore \\'juice\\' and now is the time to get it.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe lad ran to the shed where his charging wires were, and they\\n\\nwere connected in a trice. He allowed twenty-five minutes for the\\n\\ncharging, as he knew with his improved battery he could get\\n\\nenough current in that time to finish the contest. Before the red\\n\\nand green car drivers had finished installing new batteries, for\\n\\nthey could not recharge as quickly as could our hero, Tom was on\\n\\nthe track again. But, in a little while, his two rivals were\\n\\nafter him.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was now a spectacular race. Around and around swept the\\n\\nthree big cars. All the others were practically out of it. The\\n\\ncrowd became lively airs. Mile after mile was reeled off. The day\\n\\nwas passing. Tired and covered with dust from the track, Tom\\n\\nstill sat at the steering wheel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Two laps more!\" cried Mr. Sharp, as the starter\\'s pistol gave\\n\\nthis warning. \"Can you get away from \\'em, Tom?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe red and the green cars were following closely. The young\\n\\ninventor looked back and nodded. He turned on more power, almost\\n\\nto the limit--that he was saving for the final spurt. But after\\n\\nhim still came the two big cars. Suddenly the red car shot ahead,\\n\\njust as the last lap was beginning. The green tried to follow,\\n\\nbut there was a flash of fire, a loud report, and Tom knew a fuse\\n\\nhad blown out. There was no time for his rival to put in a new\\n\\none. The race was now between Tom and the red car. Could the lad\\n\\ncatch and pass it?\\n\\n\\n\\nThey were now only a mile from the finish. The red car was\\n\\nthree lengths ahead. With a quick motion Tom turned on the last\\n\\nbit of power. There seemed to come a roar from his Motor and his\\n\\ncar shot ahead. It was on even terms with the red car when what\\n\\nTom had been fearing for the last five minutes happened. his fuse\\n\\nblew out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Too bad! It\\'s all up with us!\" cried Mr. Sharp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"No!\" cried Tom in a ringing voice. \"I\\'ve got an emergency fuse\\n\\nready!\"  He snapped a switch in place, putting into commission\\n\\nanother fuse. The motor that had lost speed began to pick it up\\n\\nagain. Tom had pulled back the controller handle, but he now\\n\\nshoved it forward again, notch by notch, until it was at the\\n\\nlimit. He had fallen back from the red car, and the occupants of\\n\\nthat, with a yell of triumph, prepared to cross the line a\\n\\nwinner.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut, like a race horse that nerves himself for the last\\n\\ndesperate spurt, Tom\\'s machine fairly leaped ahead. With his\\n\\nhands gripping the rim of the steering wheel, until it seemed\\n\\nthat the bones of his fingers would protrude, Tom sent his car\\n\\nstraight for the finishing tape. There was a yell from the\\n\\nspectators. Men were standing up, waving their hats and shouting.\\n\\nWomen were fairly screaming. Mr. Damon was blessing everything\\n\\nwithin sight. Mr. Sharp, in his excitement, was pushing on the\\n\\nback of the front seats as if to shove the car ahead.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen, as the pistol announced the close of the race, Tom\\'s car,\\n\\nwith what seemed a mighty leap, like a hunter clearing a ditch,\\n\\nforged ahead, and crossed the line a length in advance of the red\\n\\ncar. Tom Swift had Won.\\n\\n\\n\\nAmid the cheers of the crowd the lad slowed up, and, at the\\n\\ndirection of the judges, wheeled back to the stand, to receive\\n\\nthe prize. A certified check for three thousand dollars was\\n\\nhanded him, and he received the congratulations of the racing\\n\\nofficials. The driver of the red car also generously praised him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You won fair and square,\" he said, shaking hands with Tom.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe young inventor and his friends drove their car to their\\n\\nshed. As Tom was descending, weary and begrimed with dust he\\n\\nheard a voice asking:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Mayn\\'t I congratulate you also?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nHe wheeled around, to confront Mary Nestor, immaculate in a\\n\\nsummer gown.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Why--why,\" he stammered. \"I--I thought you didn\\'t come.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, yes I did,\" she answered, laughing. \"I wouldn\\'t have\\n\\nmissed it for anything. I arrived late, but I saw the whole race.\\n\\nWasn\\'t it glorious. I\\'m so glad you won!\"  Tom was too, now, but\\n\\nhe shrank back when Miss Nestor held out both daintily gloved\\n\\nhands to him. His hands were covered with oil and dirt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"As if I cared for my gloves!\" she cried, and she took\\n\\npossession of his hands, a proceeding to which Tom was nothing\\n\\nloath. \"Are you going to race any more?\" she asked, as he walked\\n\\nalong by her side, away from the gathering crowd.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" he replied. \"My car is speedier than I thought\\n\\nit was. Perhaps I may enter it in other contests.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBut what Tom Swift did later on will be told in another volume,\\n\\nto be called, \"Tom Swift and His Wireless Message; or, The\\n\\nCastaways of Earthquake Island\"--a strange tale of ship-wreck and\\n\\nmystery.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe run back home was made without incident, save for a broken\\n\\nchain, easily repaired, the day following the race, and Tom later\\n\\nreceived a number of invitations to give exhibitions of speed.\\n\\nSeveral automobile manufacturers wanted to secure the rights to\\n\\nhis machine, but he said he desired to consider the matter before\\n\\nacting. He did not forget his promise to Mrs. Baggert, regarding\\n\\nthe diamond earrings, and bought her the finest pair he could\\n\\nfind.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Come on, Mr. Sharp,\" proposed Tom, a week or so after the big\\n\\nrace, \"let\\'s go for a spin in the airship. I want to see how it\\n\\nfeels to be among the clouds once more,\" and they were soon\\n\\nsoaring aloft.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe new bank, started by Mr. Foger, did not flourish long. It\\n\\nclosed its doors in less than six months, but the old institution\\n\\nwas stronger than ever. Mr. Berg disappeared, and Tom never\\n\\nlearned whether the agent really was the man he had chased, and\\n\\nwhose watch charm he tore loose, though he always had his\\n\\nsuspicions. Nor did it ever develop who crossed the electric\\n\\nwires, so that Tom was so nearly fatally shocked. Andy Foger\\n\\ndisliked our hero more than ever, and on several occasions caused\\n\\nhim not a little trouble, but Tom was able to look after himself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE END\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis Isn\\'t All!\\n\\n\\n\\nWould you like to know what became of the good friends you have\\n\\nmade in this book?\\n\\n\\n\\nWould you like to read other stories continuing their adventures\\n\\nand experiences, or other books quite as entertaining by the same\\n\\nauthor?\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the reverse side of the wrapper which comes with this book,\\n\\nyou will find a wonderful list of stories which you can buy at\\n\\nthe same store where you got this book.\\n\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t throw away the Wrapper\\n\\n\\n\\nUse it as a handy catalog of the books you want some day to have.\\n\\nBut in case you do mislay it, write to the Publishers for a\\n\\ncomplete catalog.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE TOM SWIFT SERIES\\n\\n\\n\\nBy VICTOR APPLETON\\n\\n\\n\\nUniform Style of Binding.
